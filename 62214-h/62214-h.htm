  <h2 class='c004'>REVIEW<br /> <span class='small'>OF</span><br /> <span class='large'>HON. E. B. WASHBURNE’S PAPER ON THE UNION OF THE TELEGRAPH AND POSTAL SYSTEMS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the second session of the Fortieth Congress, 1868, a bill was
introduced and a paper submitted by Hon. E. B. Washburne, of
Illinois, relating to the “Union of the Telegraph and Postal
Systems” in the United States, which has naturally attracted
public attention, and especially of that large class of our citizens
who are identified with the Telegraph interests of the country.
The paper bears upon its face such evident marks of care, and the
case is presented with so much earnestness and apparent sincerity,
notwithstanding the frequency of its errors and the illusory character
of its appeals to the practice and experience of foreign nations,
that it cannot fail to produce upon the public mind an unjust impression
that the usefulness of this great invention is injuriously
restricted, and its operations unfaithfully managed, by the organizations
having it in control.</p>

<p class='c009'>To correct these erroneous impressions by calmly and respectfully
criticising the statements thus presented, and proving the
honesty and fidelity with which the Telegraph service is performed
in this country, is the object of this paper.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>A MERITED COMPLIMENT TO PROFESSOR MORSE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the acknowledgment made by Mr. Washburne, in the
opening of his paper, that “the world is indebted to the genius of
a citizen of the United States for the practical development of the
electric telegraph as a means of communication,” we heartily concur.
That citizen is still a member of the Company to which his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>great discovery gave birth, and on whose success he largely
depends for support. To it he gives his ripened genius and
matured wisdom, justly priding himself upon the success of his
invention, and desiring for it the largest and widest use.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Professor Morse needs more than the simple honor of making
a great discovery and of placing it at the disposal of his fellow-men
throughout the world, and when it is considered that the effect of
the system proposed to be inaugurated by Mr. Washburne’s bill
would be the inevitable destruction of all existing telegraph investments,
and possibly the impoverishment of the great inventor
himself, the compliment seems a barren one indeed.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>CONGRESSIONAL AID.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Congress, it is true, aided the introduction of the Telegraph by
an appropriation of thirty thousand dollars for a public experiment
and test of its capacity. But it may well be questioned whether
this appropriation was not, after all, an injury rather than a benefit,
both to the inventor and the people. It left no property to enrich
its possessors, and no models to guide them in erecting new structures,
while it was obtained by sacrifices which have cost the
inventor infinite sorrow, and clouded a score of years with litigation.
The time occupied by Congress in the consideration of the
offer of the invention to government for one hundred thousand
dollars (which was rejected) consumed nearly two years of the
patent, and exposed the inventor to the endurance of a most annoying
uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Government, however, most effectually insured its successful
extension, when, contrary to the practice of European powers,
it declined to assume the control of the Telegraph, and referred
its inventor, after the thorough investigation of the Postmaster-General,
to the people as the proper recipients of his discovery.
It was the healthy act of a government which recognized its duty
to protect, instead of absorbing, the enterprises of its citizens.
That duty is as clear to-day as it was then.</p>

<p class='c009'>When government rejected the control and ownership of the
Telegraph, although offered for so paltry a sum by the inventor, it
was accepted by the people as a legitimate enterprise, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>have given to it all the capital, skill, and labor required for the
fullest development of its usefulness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although many years elapsed after the introduction of the
Telegraph in this country during which it maintained but a
feeble existence through numerous weak and limited organizations,
that rendered the business expensive and precarious, it now begins
to crystallize into strength and harmony; and the projectors and
promoters of the enterprise feel that they have a right to expect
the fruit of their labors, in the proper and legitimate return which
the humblest citizen receives for his work, and which government
was, in part at least, organized to secure. We therefore pronounce
the Washburne bill an unwarranted and unjust measure, which,
while proposing an ostensible public good, essays to provide it by
the destruction of vast private interests for which it proposes no
compensation.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ERRONEOUS CHARGES AGAINST THE AMERICAN TELEGRAPH SYSTEM.</h3>

<p class='c011'>To the charges made by Mr. Washburne, in the prefatory sentences
of his paper, against the management of the Telegraph
system of the United States, little need be said. They are without
the shadow of proof, and require no other answer than an
explicit denial. Yet American telegraph companies may justly
complain that a public man, while ostensibly performing a service
in the interests of the people, should deem it necessary to traduce
a vast interest by the use of terms so broad as to attract to it,
even without proof of their justice, unwarranted disparagement
and suspicion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Washburne’s statement that “the telegraphic system has
made less progress toward perfection, and has been practically
of less value to the masses of the people in our country, than
in any other civilized country on the globe,” is so sweepingly
erroneous as to excite our profound astonishment, which is
increased by the still broader assertion that, “while in nearly
every country in Europe the telegraph has become a speedy,
certain, and economical medium of communication, the inestimable
benefits of which are extended to the inhabitants of small towns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>and communes as well as to the great centres of trade, in this
country telegraphic communication has always been uncertain and
expensive, and limited to chief towns and cities.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>BRIEF STATEMENT OF FACTS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In reply to the above we desire to present the following facts.</p>

<p class='c009'>The population of Europe at the last authentic census was
288,001,365, nineteen twentieths of which belonged to the Caucasian
race. It contains thirty-nine cities, each possessing more
than one hundred thousand inhabitants, and the accumulated
wealth of nearly two thousand years of civilization.</p>

<p class='c009'>The United States has a population of only 31,148,047, and
contains but ten cities of one hundred thousand inhabitants, while
its utmost civilized history reaches back scarcely two and a half
centuries, and the accumulated wealth of its civilization cannot
average fifty years throughout its cultivated area.</p>

<p class='c009'>The population of Europe being nearly ten times greater than
that of the United States, as is also its accumulations of years
of civilization, while, according to Mr. Washburne, its telegraph
facilities vastly outstrip ours, it should, of course, possess far
more than ten times the number of telegraph offices.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, in truth, there is not even an approximation to this provision
of telegraphic convenience based on population; for while
the United States alone possess 4,126 telegraph offices, all Europe
contains but 6,450, of which 2,151, or more than one third of the
whole number, belong to Great Britain, where the telegraph
has heretofore been free from government control.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is significant of American enterprise that continental Europe,
with a population of 260,000,000, possesses but one hundred and
seventy-three more telegraph offices than the United States, with
her 31,000,000 of widely scattered people. While in the United
States there is a telegraph office to every 7,549 of its inhabitants,
in continental Europe there is only one to every 60,249!</p>

<p class='c009'>The following table will serve to show the proportion of telegraph
offices to population in the principal countries of Europe
and of the United States, the number of miles of line, and amount
of telegraph business of each.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. From the Annual Cyclopædia. New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1868.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In large sections of the United States the proportion is much
greater. Thus, the Pacific States embrace an area of 600,000
square miles; Belgium, 11,000. The former provide an office to
every 2,500 of their population; the latter, one to every 12,416.
Thus, the Pacific States sustain five times as many offices in proportion
to population as Belgium, to say nothing of the great disparity
in the condition of service by the vast range of wild territory
occupied by the one, and the fine roads and cultivated area
of the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>In view of the facts shown in the preceding table, how can it be
said that in America the telegraph is less practically provided to
the people than in any other civilized country on the globe?</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE COMPLAINT OF INDIFFERENCE TO PUBLIC CONVENIENCE WITHOUT FOUNDATION.</h3>

<p class='c016'>“Instead of an auxiliary to the postal system, controlled, like it, by the
state, sought, like it, to be made useful to the great masses of the people
without regard to the pecuniary profit to be secured, as in nearly every
civilized country in the world, we see the system in this country in the
hands of rival companies, anxious only for profit, extending their lines
only to prominent places where such profits are to be secured, and too indifferent
to the public convenience. In short, the popular verdict of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>people of this country, if it could be heard, would be that the telegraphic
system, in view of what it is in other countries and might become in this,
is practically a failure.”</p>

<p class='c009'><i>The above complaint is without the least foundation. In no
country in the world is there so vast a system of lines under one
control as in this; in no country is the business done so well or so
cheaply; and nowhere else has there ever been so earnest an endeavor
made to serve the people faithfully and satisfactorily.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>A great majority of the towns in this country having even less than
five hundred inhabitants are already supplied with offices, and they
are rapidly increasing. During the past two and a half years more
than one million of dollars have been spent by the Western Union
Telegraph Company alone in the construction of new lines, and
during the same period it has opened more than eight hundred
new offices. This it is constantly doing, as much to satisfy existing
public wants as for the promotion of its own future interest.
Over one hundred offices have long been sustained at a loss,
because needed to protect the lines built through comparatively
desert regions to reach distant points of intercourse, and several
hundred more are maintained which barely pay expenses. In fact,
it is a standing rule of the company to open and maintain a telegraph
office at all places in the United States reached by its lines,
on a guaranty that the receipts shall be equal to the necessary
expenses; and, by associating the duties of the telegraphic service
with other productive labor, they are often rendered extremely
light. It also offers to extend its lines to any place not reached by
existing lines, where the inhabitants will advance the cost of building
them, the money so advanced to be refunded to the contributors
in telegraphing at ordinary tariffs. Under this arrangement a
large number of offices have been opened and extensive lines built,
to the satisfaction of all parties.</p>

<p class='c009'>Into such arrangements the government could not enter with
any similar rapidity, or by so healthy and economic processes accomplish
a like amount of substantial benefit to the people. The
fact that there is scarcely a community to be found anywhere in
America where the people are unable to meet these offers of the
Telegraph Company, is the best reason why government should
not furnish at public expense what the people are so able to provide
for themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>In reply to the statement that our company is anxious only for
profit, and that its charges are exorbitant as compared with those
of other countries, we respectfully call attention to the following

<h3 class='c010'>THE ASSERTED UNION OF THE POSTAL AND TELEGRAPH SYSTEMS IN EUROPE AN ERROR.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In referring to the action of European governments, in their
early recognition of the telegraph system, Mr. Washburne says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“At once, after the invention and successful establishment of electric
telegraphs, every government in Europe where lines were built, except
that of Great Britain, established a telegraphic system in connection with
its postal system. <i>Anticipating, as they might well do, that in private
hands it might be so constructed as to draw to it, by its speed, safety, and
economy, a large proportion of the correspondence, and thus become a
rival of the post</i>, these governments, acting in the interests of the people,
have made the system part and parcel of the postal system, and have
thrown around it all the safeguards which in every civilized country the
postal system enjoys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The above statement, with the exception of that portion printed
in italics, is remarkably incorrect.</p>

<p class='c009'>In no country in Europe does it appear that the telegraphic
administration is connected with the post-office.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> In France and
Spain the telegraphs are under the control of the Minister of
the Interior. In Russia, Prussia, and Italy they belong to the
Ministry of Public Works. In Belgium the telegraph, railways,
and the post-office form a general division under the Minister of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Public Works, but are kept distinct. In Austria the administrations
of the telegraphs and the post-office were at one time united,
but it was found expedient to separate them. In Switzerland the
telegraphic organization is nearly the same as Prussia’s; the post-office,
customs, and private establishments supply the elements
of an auxiliary staff, but all the persons employed in the transmission
or delivery of telegrams depend on the administration of
Telegraphs for their compensation, and in the annual budget an
appropriation is made for that service distinct from the post.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>

page 131.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>An effort was made in France in 1864 to consolidate the post-office
and telegraph service, but, owing to the strong opposition
evinced on the part of the chief functionaries of both services
to such amalgamation, it was relinquished.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not until several years after the introduction of the electric
telegraph in America that it was opened to the people by any
European government. Even in France the electric telegraph was
established as late as 1851, and its spread throughout the empire
was exceedingly slow. The semaphore telegraph, a defective and
inefficient system of conveying intelligence by the exhibition
of signals,—introduced by Napoleon at the beginning of the
present century,—was still in use, and, notwithstanding the manifest
advantages of the electric telegraph, as shown by Arago to
the House of Deputies, government long refused to employ it, and,
when finally adopted, it was for some time used in connection
with the old system.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE SHORTCOMINGS OF BRITISH TELEGRAPHS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Washburne says of the British telegraph:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“In Great Britain, as in the United States, the telegraph was left to
private enterprise and competition. Only a few weeks since, after a
twenty years’ trial of the system in the hands of private companies, the
people of the British islands, with singular unanimity, demanded to have
the telegraphic system placed under the control of the postal authorities,
and a bill was introduced by the present government for that purpose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is complained of Great Britain, which provides one quarter of
all the telegraph offices in Europe, that the telegraph companies
there have left eighty-eight places in England and Wales having a
population of two thousand and upwards, and even whole districts,
without an office.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Whatever may be true of the meagreness of the provision of
telegraphic facilities by English companies, and which these companies
vigorously deny, no such complaint can, with justice, be
made in the United States, notwithstanding the vast ranges of territory
which must be traversed to meet the communities which need
and ask for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without intending any disrespect to the postal authorities of the
United States, it may be said that the post-office system of Great
Britain, because of the superior character of the control which long
and careful study has enabled it to secure, is far in advance of our
own. In fact, there is nothing more apparent to an English visitor
than the low <i>status</i> of our postal arrangements, as compared with
that of his own country. It is natural, therefore, seeing the postal
system so admirably managed, that English merchants, whose
tendencies are all toward governmental direction in matters of this
character,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> should desire to see the experiment of a similar control
of the telegraph. In fact, it is only this class of citizens who have
asked for the change, the memorial having gone solely from the
different Chambers of Commerce throughout the kingdom, no appeal
on the subject having ever been made to or by the people of
Great Britain, and therefore the assertion that the people with
singular unanimity demanded it is not sustained by the facts.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. Witness the proposition recently so much discussed in England, that the government
should assume control of the railways also.</p>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>THE TELEGRAPH SYSTEM OF THE UNITED STATES UNPARALLELED FOR ITS EXTENT AND EFFICIENCY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Washburne says, “There is abundant reason to believe
that the telegraphic system of Great Britain, which is declared a
failure on such high authority, is, in all respects, greatly superior
to our own”; but he fails to give any of his reasons for this belief,
and we are compelled to assert that it has no intelligent explanation
except in a strangely morbid hostility to this company, which
exhibits itself on every offered occasion. In all respects the
telegraph lines of this country are equal to those of any other, and
in some important ones superior. They extend from the Gulf of
St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the
Pacific Ocean, connecting in one unbroken chain more than four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>thousand cities and villages, forming a system by which every
event of importance happening in any section of our vast territorial
limits is published within a few hours in every other; through
which verbatim reports of the speeches in Congress are transmitted
from the capital to the metropolis, and full abstracts of them to
every considerable town in the nation, on the day of their delivery;
which supplies the metropolitan journals with more telegraphic
news every day than is contained in the combined press despatches
of Europe. Such a system, in its vastness, skilful manipulation, and
the rapidity of its unceasing development, we believe merits the
public approbation, and is not unworthy of the American name.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our system of telegraphy is unique. Nowhere else can there
be found such an extent of lines under one control. The lines
of the Western Union Telegraph Company, extending throughout
the United States and portions of the Dominion of Canada, enables
it to transmit messages between every section of the country, without
undergoing the delay of checking or booking at intermediate
points; and between most of the large cities without retransmission.
This work, over a territory so vast, although only two
years have elapsed since the confederation of lines was effected
which made it possible, is fast assuming, under increased care and
enlarged experience, the certainty and uniformity of mechanism.
In all its effective features, the world may safely be challenged to
produce anything to compare with it. The extent of lines and
wire belonging to the Western Union Telegraph Company is more
than twice that of France, three times greater than that of Prussia,
and equals the aggregated systems of Austria, Prussia, and the
lesser German States, Italy, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland,
and it is increasing in larger ratio than any European system.
The Western Union Telegraph Company alone has added to its
lines, during the year 1868, more than five thousand miles of wire,
or as much as the entire system of Belgium, leaving unsatisfied
demands for an equal extension in the year to come.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ASSERTED EFFECT OF GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL ON BELGIAN TELEGRAPHS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Washburne says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“In Belgium, where the telegraph has always been under the control of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the government, the charge for telegraphing twenty words throughout the
kingdom is half a franc, or, say ten cents of our money. In Switzerland
the charge is the same. In both these countries offices are opened in
nearly every town and village; in both telegraphing is reliable and certain;
<i>complaints of delays and errors are almost unknown, and the lines
in both countries yield large profits</i>.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f6'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. See official acknowledgment of inefficiency on pages <a href='#Page_18'>18</a> and <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>; also, on page
<a href='#Page_96'>96</a>, an admitted loss in performing the service at established rates.</p>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“In Belgium, in the year 1853, with an average charge of 5 francs and
7 centimes, or say $1.02 for twenty words to any part of the kingdom,
the number of messages sent was 52,050, yielding, francs, 265,536. In
the year 1866, with the charge reduced to about 17 cents for twenty
words, the number of messages had increased to 1,128,005, yielding,
francs, 962,213. The same remarkable increase is found in the statistics
of the telegraphic system of all countries where the telegraph is under
government control.”</p>

<p class='c009'>If by the latter clause of this statement it is designed to convey
the idea that government control, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, stimulates the use of the
telegraph, or that even a reduction of rates, without this control, is
incapable of producing this result, it may justly be challenged as
utterly unsustained by the telegraphic experience of this country.
The coupling together of these two influences seems designed to
prove that the one necessarily involves the other, whereas the question
of rate is altogether independent of management, whether
government or individual.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>EARLY BELGIAN RATES CONTRASTED WITH AMERICAN.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Respecting the Belgian tariff of 1853, of $1.02 in gold per message,
for a distance not exceeding fifty miles, it must be regarded
as prohibitory, except to those whose necessities compelled its use.
The American charge at the same period for even greater distances
was twenty-five cents. Instead, therefore, of any surprise
at the comparatively limited use of the telegraph by the Belgian
people under the circumstances, it may well be regarded as extraordinary
that it was used so much.</p>

<p class='c009'>Had private companies in the United States attempted to impose
such a tariff at the period named, public opinion would have compelled
an immediate reduction. While there can be no doubt that,
within certain limits, a diminished tariff will usually be followed by
an increase in the number of messages, experience has demonstrated
that this cannot be relied on as invariably true, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>where the charge has been unreasonable or exorbitant. It must
be remembered that, when a tariff has been reduced one half,
there must be an increase of more than one hundred per cent in
the number of despatches, to yield the same revenue, meet the cost
of added labor, and provide the necessary additional means of
transmission. So great an addition in the number of messages,
unattended with a corresponding increase of wires and operators,
would result in such delay and inaccuracy as to render the service
of no value.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NATURAL INCREASE IN TELEGRAPHY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It should be remembered, too, that an increase follows the supply
of more ample facilities, when these have been inadequate to the
wants of the communities for which they are provided.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is also a large natural increase, altogether irrespective of
the charges for transmission, which must be allowed for, before the
legitimate effect of the inducements presented by cheapness, or
the opportunities furnished by the multiplication of wires or increased
capacity in the machinery, can be estimated. Thus, in
December, 1848, which in the United States bears a fair comparison
with Belgium in 1852 as to date of telegraphic introduction,
at the office in Buffalo, N. Y., the receipts amounted to
$330.54; while in the same month of 1867, with no decrease in
the tariff, the receipts were $5,392.07,—an increase of over 1,600
per cent, and exceeding by 400 per cent that which in Belgium
was caused, as claimed, by reducing the tariff from $1.02 to 17
cents, but which, in Buffalo, resulted from simple natural increase
caused by the growth of the country and enlarged telegraphic
facilities. The annual gross receipts of the Magnetic Telegraph
Company, extending between New York and Washington, were
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'>Up to the close of 1848 the above company had a monopoly of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the telegraph service between these two cities, but in March, 1849,
the House Printing Line commenced operations between New
York and Philadelphia, and, together with Bain’s Chemical Telegraph,
was continued through to Washington in the autumn of
that year, so that from 1848 to 1852 the above statement only
shows the receipts of one of the three lines doing business between
these places. If the receipts of the other two companies were as
large, it exhibits the remarkable increase in the amount of business
done, in five years, of more than 900 per cent, without any reduction
in rates.</p>

<p class='c009'>The number of messages transmitted by the Magnetic Company
in 1852 was 253,857, at an average cost, according to the
receipts, of forty cents each.</p>

<p class='c009'>The average cost of the French telegrams for the same year,

was no opposition, the expenses exceeded the receipts by $1,199.00.
One of the three lines was sold at public auction twice within three
years after its construction, to pay the debts incurred in operating
it. In 1853 two of the lines were united under one control, and
an amicable arrangement entered into between the two remaining

<p class='c009'>When the Belgian lines were opened to the public, an act of the
legislature, dated March 15, 1851, established a charge of 2½ francs for
a message of twenty words, if transmitted within a circle of 75 kilometres
(i.e. 50 cents in gold for a distance of about 46½ miles), and five francs
(one dollar gold) for any distance beyond the limit of 75 kilometres.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>The increase from 52,050 messages in Belgium in 1853 to
1,128,005 in 1866 is, no doubt, in part justly attributable to the
reduction of the prohibitory tariff of the former year, but it is not
greater or more remarkable than the increase during the same
period in America, where no reduction from the early rates has
been made, and where, nevertheless, the business has improved
year by year until it has grown into its present volume, exceeding
that of any nation on the globe, on whatever basis the comparison
be placed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Belgium transmitted 14,025 messages in 1851 and 52,050 in
1853, being an increase of nearly 400 per cent in three years,
although the tariff had been reduced less than 20 per cent. From
1853 to 1862 there was an increase of over 500 per cent, with
a reduction of tariff of about 52 per cent. From 1862 to 1867
there was an increase of less than 400 per cent, although the
average tariff had been reduced from 2.07 to 0.85 francs, or
about 60 per cent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Other suggestive illustrations are contained in the tables furnished
by Mr. Washburne. Thus, in Switzerland, in 1853, at
an average cost of 1.55 francs per message, the number sent was
82,586. In 1854, at an average cost of 1.62 francs, 129,167 were
sent, showing an increase of 46,581 messages at a higher tariff.
In 1855, when the cost per message was almost identical with
that of 1853, the number had increased to 162,851, or about 100
per cent. In 1859, when the cost of messages was 1.48, as compared
with 1.35 in 1858, the number had increased from 247,102
to 286,876, and in 1861, at the average charge of 1859, had increased
from 286,876 to 333,933. In 1857 and 1862 the charges
were exactly alike, yet the increase in the number of messages in
the latter year was 113,288, or over 43 per cent over the former.
The tables furnished by other countries show similar results. In
Prussia, in 1852, 48,751 messages were sent at an average cost
of 2.35, while in 1858, at a cost increased to 2.95, 247,292 messages
were sent, or an increase of over 400 per cent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The effect of the policies of the two nations thus shown to be so
dissimilar are instructive.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Belgium, finding it necessary to reduce her tariff to one
franc, thereby first attempted to popularize the use of the telegraph,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>it was done, notwithstanding all its advantages of free rents,
absence of taxes, and labor vastly cheaper than in the United
States, at a loss to the state of 41,417.19 francs. And when,
upon the idea that a still lower tariff might so develop the public
use of the lines as to render them self-sustaining, the Belgian
government in 1866 reduced the tariff one half, its expenditures
were increased thereby from 653,280 francs in 1863 to 1,217,496
francs, entailing a loss of 255,282,000 francs, as shown by Mr.
Washburne’s report. In the United States, by keeping the tariff
at the lowest paying rates, the system has been extended to every
part of the country, touching the extreme limits of civilization,
and its realm of usefulness is yearly increasing.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE PECULIARITIES OF THE BELGIAN TELEGRAPH SERVICE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The telegraph business of Belgium is peculiar. Half of it only
can be said to be Belgian at all, the other half being messages in
transit, or international, which are sent at comparatively little cost,
and for the transmission of which it makes terms with other nations.
On the inland or Belgium business proper, the only class which can
with any propriety be used in the argument in hand, there was,
as has been seen, a loss in 1866 of thirty-four per cent, and in
1867 of thirty-seven and a half per cent. The greater cost of an
inland message arises from the fact that it is received, forwarded,
and delivered in the kingdom, requiring the various service connected
with such duties; while transit messages simply pass through
the state, and impose no expense for labor in transmission, reception,
or delivery, and international messages require no delivery
in the country sending them.</p>

<p class='c009'>But besides its annual losses to government, there exists a serious
drawback in the value to the people of the reduced tariff. The
diminished rate in Belgium is accompanied by no promise of prompt
delivery. Despatches at a half-franc each must take their chance
of transmission, and submit to the delay caused by other service.
Speed rates are established to compensate for loss by the reduced
tariff. Thus, a message requiring immediate transit is charged
three times an ordinary message, reversing the plan of the Western
Union Company, which transmits promptly and indiscriminately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>at ordinary rates, but makes an immense reduction when the night
hours can be used. Of course business men, to whom time is
money, are obliged to pay an extra franc to secure that promptness
and certainty of transmission without which the telegraph is
of little value for all important transactions. The tariff has been,
therefore, practically increased to one and a half francs, or forty-two
cents for distances which cannot average more than seventy-five
miles, and probably do not exceed fifty. The cheap messages
take their chance. In America, a repeated message is
charged half a rate more than the ordinary tariff. In Belgium
it pays four single rates. Cipher messages are also charged four
times the price of ordinary messages, while here they are received
at ordinary rates.</p>

<p class='c009'>Were the United States government to construct lines under
the Washburne bill, and adopt this Belgian system, its tariffs between
Washington and Baltimore—about the average distance of
the Belgian service—would be, for prompt delivery such as our
telegraph companies perform, <i>forty-five cents</i>, instead of the existing
charge of ten cents; for messages to which no assurance of
promptitude is given, fifteen cents; and for repeated messages,
<i>sixty cents</i>, instead of our present rate of fifteen cents. If, now,
with all its advantages of cheap labor and the profits arising from
international and transit messages, the Belgian government, on
these bases of charge, admits a clear loss in 1866 of 255,282
francs, how will it be possible for Mr. Washburne to secure a
profit to government large enough in a few years to pay the
cost of the line, on a common tariff of fifteen cents for all classes
of messages?</p>

<h3 class='c010'>BELGIAN OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THEIR SYSTEM.</h3>

<p class='c011'>As Mr. Washburne claims for European telegraphs speed, certainty,
and economy, it is well to be able to read Belgian official
testimony on the same subject. The last report of the Belgian
department of public works has the following paragraph:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Imperfection has existed at all times and in all places. It is in vain
to attempt to obtain equally rapid and exact transmission under all circumstances.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Delay will occur, whatever may be done to prevent it, by
the blocking up of lines, by a temporary influx of business; and, in a
country where distances are short, that delay may equal, and sometimes
even exceed, the time that would be occupied in transmitting by
railway.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Official truthfulness and modesty thus lifts the veil from a system
held up for our admiration, and reveals its weakness.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>INSTRUCTIVE HISTORY OF BELGIAN TELEGRAPHS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The history of the use of the telegraph in Belgium is instructive.</p>

<p class='c009'>During 1851, the first recorded year of its existence, there passed
between the offices of the whole of that kingdom, as shown by
Mr. Washburne’s tables, twenty-one messages per day. If we may
suppose, what seems scarcely credible, that only five of her chief
cities were at that time connected by the wires,—Ghent, Antwerp,
Brussels, Bruges, and Liege,—it exhibited the remarkable spectacle
of a telegraph line opened by government “in the interest of the
people,” used to the extent of about four messages per day at each
of her five chief cities!</p>

<p class='c009'>Even after four years more had been used in the extension
of her lines, the daily transmission only increased to fifty-five
messages per day for the whole kingdom, showing how slowly and
jealously the lines were given to public employment, and how
utterly futile is the assertion that the public interest, at that time
at least, controlled the state in their management.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tariff, which had averaged during the first year $1.26 per
message, and had not, so far, been practically reduced, showed still
more clearly that only the rich used it, and that it was, on account
of its cost, practically beyond the employment of the people. The
truth is, as Mr. Washburne states, that the Belgian government,
fearing its use in private hands, and suspicious that by private
energy the telegraph would be made to rival, if not ruin, the
Belgian post, seized and held it from popular control. There is
certainly nothing in the first five years of its existence in Belgium
which proves that government, as is claimed, desired to give the
fruits of a great invention to the Belgian people. During all of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>these years, however, and in marked contrast to the lines under
government management everywhere, hundreds of thousands of
messages were passing over the telegraph lines in the United States,
at a tariff which made them available to all its citizens, and showing
a daily record in some of the smaller of its inland towns greater
than that of all the Belgian offices combined.</p>

<p class='c009'>When in 1866 the Belgian government, by the radical reduction
of the tariff to half a franc, endeavored to render the service
more generally useful to the people, it did so at the expense of the
public treasury; since on each of the 2,180 inland messages
transmitted per day a loss of thirty-eight centimes, or more than
two thirds the established rate, was sustained; and, as we have
elsewhere stated, this loss would have been much greater, but for
a profit derived from international and transit messages, which went
to the credit of the whole service.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>SINGULAR IDEA THAT A SMALL TELEGRAPH SYSTEM IS MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THAN A LARGE ONE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>“It appears to be tolerably clear,” says Mr. Washburne, “that,
in order to assert the superiority of a system on a small scale, it
requires even more care and greater attention to cope with an increased
traffic than an establishment whose ramifications embrace
a larger sphere.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This remark is made with reference to the necessity of great
promptitude in the delivery of messages in Belgium, where the
places connected are contiguous, and conveyance by railroad rapid
and frequent. It is made also to show that it is more difficult
under such circumstances to cope with an enlarged use of the
telegraph than in the United States, where, by reason of distance
and the comparative infrequency of transit by railroad, the necessity
of promptitude is presumably less urgent.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first the argument seems fair, but when examined, it has no
foundation except in the general fact that distance and infrequent
transit by rail may render the telegraph valuable and desirable,
even without the promptness essential where transit is rapid and
frequent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The weakness of the argument is evident when it is seen that,
as distances decrease, all the elements of cost and maintenance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>lines and the difficulties arising from elemental disturbances, lessen
in the same proportion. This admits of easy illustration. Look
for a moment at Belgium, of which Mr. Washburne treats so copiously.
Located centrally in that kingdom, in the form of a triangle,
and separated from each other by about thirty miles each,
are her three chief cities, Ghent, Brussels, and Antwerp. To connect
either two of these a line of telegraph thirty miles long is
required, which government builds upon its own property and
protects by its own police. However thoroughly built, its cost is
necessarily small. There is no trouble or uncertainty in working it.
Its very shortness renders its perfection in the use of all the appliances
which science and experience have shown desirable readily
and cheaply attainable, and it is easily kept in order. When increased
public use imperils promptness by the limited provision
of wires, ten men, in a single week, can erect another. In all this
the very proximity of the points to be connected facilitates and
economizes every step required in meeting the enlarged necessities.</p>

<p class='c009'>The management of such lines, short, well-guarded, and permanent,
is almost solely confined to the arrangements for transmission
and delivery.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Belgium, therefore, which contains only two thirds as many
offices as the Western Union Telegraph Company maintains in the
State of New York alone, with her commercial centres near together,
with an average of less than three wires on her poles, with
her 2,232 miles of line on government property and protected by
its authority, want of promptness would be inexcusable, because so
easily effected. Were New York and Chicago only thirty miles
apart, and all the messages of the United States, now approximating
thirteen millions per annum, required to be passed between
them at the rate of 36,000 per day, and within an average
of fifteen minutes from the time of their reception, as is now done
between the Chambers of Commerce of these cities, it could be
accomplished with comparative ease, and especially so were the
land which the wires traversed the property of the company, and
the lines guarded by the nation. Once render it easy and inexpensive
to provide a reliable outward structure, and the work of
the telegraph becomes a matter of simple internal organization,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>except as competition and the necessities of extension in a land
so vast as ours adds to the ordinary cares of administration. The
immense distances between our centres of commerce, the multitude
of far separated radiating centres of business, the great exposure
and defective protection of our lines, and constantly increasing
system of wires which are constructed as rapidly as new
demands for their extension are made, render the management
of this company one of the most arduous and complicated of private
enterprises. There is nothing in Europe or elsewhere which
bears any proper resemblance to the American telegraph system,
nor with which it can be properly compared.</p>

<p class='c009'>Between the systems of Belgium and the United States we
witness the following marked contrast. The companies here have
only one tariff for transmission, and all take their turn. The payment
of an extra franc cannot, as in Belgium, purchase priority,
or give one advantage over his neighbor. This is an imposition
of the government, similar to, and even less defensible, than that
which in England requires four postages to secure the safety of
a letter. Here the companies offer to guarantee the public against
error by an extra payment of one half the ordinary tariff; but
the public, because of their confidence in the company, do not avail
themselves of this provision, to an extent of one in ten thousand!
Messages sent in cipher, for which no extra charge is made in the
United States, can only be sent in Europe by the payment of four
ordinary tariffs, and in some states in Europe, and among others
France, the government will not permit their being sent at all.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NECESSITY FOR THE UNIFICATION OF THE TELEGRAPH SYSTEM.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It is curious to observe that the reasons assigned for the advantages
to be gained by governmental control are precisely the
same which led to the consolidation under one management of
the great mass of the American lines, and which has led to the
unjust charge of monopoly as the work of unification has progressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Scudamore says: “When I began to collect the information
on which this report is based, I was not free from doubts as to the
propriety of the scheme; but, after patiently collecting and considering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>all the data which I could obtain, I found myself driven,
by the mere force of facts, to the conclusion at which I have
arrived. This conclusion, indeed, is almost identical with that to
which the directors of the Electric and International Telegraph
Company came in the year 1852, and which they thus stated to
their stockholders:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“The delays, inaccuracies, and expense of the continental telegraphs
are an exemplification of the great advantage to the public
of the administration <i>being under a single management</i>. <i>This circumstance
alone admits of the establishment of a low and uniform
tariff....</i> The telegraph has already become a most powerful
and useful agent, and has, in a measure, been adopted as a means
of communication by persons employed in commercial pursuits,
but, owing to the want of proper arrangement and facilities, and
the fact of the management of the lines being divided <i>by several
companies</i>, without unison in action or interest, the public
generally have been debarred from benefiting by the immense
accommodation and advantages the telegraph is capable of affording.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In presenting the same idea, Mr. Washburne, with a looseness
of statement for which we know of no proper justification, remarks
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“There can be no doubt that the superiority of the continental system
over every other is due to the fact that the telegraph there is a government
institution, while in this country it is left to private enterprise. Individual
and associated effort have done much, but, with the confusion of
our telegraphic system before us, it would be folly to shut our eyes to the
inherent weakness of all joint-stock enterprises. Absence of responsibility,
waste of labor, irresolute councils, expensive management, want of effective
control over subordinates, are among the evils of such associations, to
say nothing of the imperative demands of stockholders that dividends
shall be made and that none shall be hazarded. Under government control
one governing body would do the work now done by twenty, and the
obligation to realize profits would not interfere to prevent the reduction
of rates or the proper extension of the system.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Passing over the charges of “waste, irresponsibility, and irresolute
councils,” which serve to round the paragraph in which they
occur, the focal idea is the efficiency secured by a united control.
That is the very basis of this company’s organization. Discarding
as false and perilous any general assumption of the enterprises of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the people by the government, and accepting its refusal to attach
the telegraph to its administration, when offered to it by its inventor,
as for the best interest of the nation, this company early saw that
united action between the extremes of our territorial limits was as
essential to its own success as to public convenience. With numerous
companies, of limited jurisdiction, and tariffs on all bases,—which
had to be added and dovetailed to each other whenever a
despatch passed between two distant places,—there was neither
certainty of correctness, promptitude, nor the possibility of a low
and uniform tariff. To secure all of these the leading telegraph
organizations combined. It was a step necessary alike for public
usefulness and success, and is accomplishing all that could be desired.
The system has penetrated farther, and compassed more
territory than separate organizations could have attempted or than
even government itself would have been willing to undertake.
Its administration is vast, harmonious, liberal, exact, economical,
and just. It uses its revenues largely to extend its realm of usefulness
to the people of every section of the country. It seeks to
secure the highest skill and character in its employees. Its aim
is to give the wires to the use of the whole people on the lowest

<h3 class='c010'>ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF BUILDING TELEGRAPH LINES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Washburne says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Any one at all familiar with the prices of materials and labor in the
various countries will see that, as to materials for the construction of lines,
they are cheaper here than in any European country, and that the whole
cost of constructing telegraphic lines must be less here than in Belgium
or Switzerland. In the latter country a large proportion of the lines are
erected upon iron posts, the prime cost of which with the stone base is from
$6 to $9 each, or from five to seven times the cost of the posts usually employed
in America.</p>

<p class='c018'>“As to the exact cost of constructing lines in the United States it is difficult
to procure reliable data. There are few questions apparently so
simple upon which so many conflicting opinions have been printed. So
simple a matter as the cost of posts, say thirty feet long, the placing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>them in the earth, furnishing and placing the necessary iron wires and
insulators and the fitting up of stations with instruments and furniture,
ought not, one would suppose, to be a difficult thing to fix. Yet persons
claiming to be experts, and even authorities in all matters relating to telegraphs,
have differed very widely. Mr. Prescott, a telegraph superintendent,
and the author of a work on ‘Electric Telegraphs,’ estimates the
cost of a mile of telegraph, built as they ordinarily are, at $61.80<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a>....</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f7'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. This statement was written in 1859, and the object of the author was to show the
inferior manner in which a majority of the lines were constructed at that time.</p>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“This is about the cost of construction of a majority of our lines, but
if built as they should be, they would cost $150 per mile. If additional
wires are added, each wire put up would be, per mile, $32.80.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Washburne’s statement, that telegraph lines can be built
cheaper in the United States than in Europe, is entirely incorrect.
Labor, wire, machinery, insulators, and every appliance peculiar
to the telegraph, are very much cheaper in Europe than in America,
and large importations of wire are constantly being made
from Belgium and England, notwithstanding the heavy duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>The difference in the cost of labor in Europe and America
is very great. The most recent authentic publication on the
subject<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> states that the general average rates paid for all kinds
of labor in the United Kingdom are as follows: For adult males,
in England, $4.96 per week; in Scotland, $4.52; in Ireland,
$3.16. For boys and youths, under twenty years of age, in
England, $1.44; in Scotland, $1.70; in Ireland, $1.38. For
adult women, in England, $2.76; in Scotland, $2.32; in Ireland,
$2.06. For girls, under twenty years of age, in England,
$1.88; in Scotland, $1.80; in Ireland, $1.62. These rates are
stated to be high, as compared with other countries in Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Belgium, coal-miners earn from 33 cents to $1.00 per day,
the average being 56 cents. In iron-furnaces, a puddler earns

earn $1.10, and second-class 83 cents.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the working classes in the United Kingdom are included
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>all who, whether as workers for others or as workers for

<p class='c009'>The cost of a telegraph line depends, like the cost of a house
or any other structure, upon how it is built, but Mr. Washburne,
or any other intelligent man, ought to know that the price appropriated
in his bill for a four-wire line from Washington to New
York cannot possibly build it, even should government build such
a structure as those which a dozen years ago cursed the enterprise,
and made it a reproach and shame. When government
builds a line of telegraph on the plea of public necessity, it should
require that its structures at least be equal to those of its citizens.
It is not strange that, with the crude and cheap ideas formed by
Mr. Washburne of telegraph structures, he disparages and undervalues
the properties of the existing companies, and ridicules the
estimates furnished Congress in their communications.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>DOUBTS REGARDING THE ESTIMATES OF TELEGRAPH EXPERTS AS TO COST OF CONSTRUCTING LINES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>We quote from Mr. Washburne’s paper:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“In February, 1866, when, in view of the establishment of an experimental
government line of telegraph, the Postmaster-General was called
upon for information ‘in regard to the feasibility and usefulness of
establishing, in connection with the Post-Office Department, telegraph
lines,’ &amp;c., ‘to be opened to the public at minimum rates of charge,&nbsp;... and such statistics and exhibits predicated on cost of construction
and capacity of transmission as will best illustrate its practicability,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>he sent to Congress lengthy statements, all of them prepared by
persons believed to be interested in or officers of existing companies,
in which the cost of a telegraphic line with six wires is put down by one
writer at $1,400 per mile, by others at $665, exclusive of river cables
and lines through cities.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Among other statements so furnished is an amended one by Mr.
Prescott, whose statement, when made part of a work intended as
authority in telegraphic matters, is quoted above. For reasons not
explained his views underwent a marked change between 1860 and
1866, and he makes haste to refute his own previous statements. His
revised statement is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘It is well known by every person who has any knowledge of telegraphy in
this country previous to the publication of my work in 1860, that comparatively
few lines had been at that time even tolerably well constructed; and one object
which I had in view in writing it was to call attention to this prevailing fault,
and endeavor to get a better system inaugurated.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Since then there has been a very marked improvement in the construction
of telegraph lines in this country. Small poles, of inferior wood, which required
renewing every few years, have given place to large and more enduring ones of
chestnut and cedar, and small iron wire, which offered great resistance to the
passage of the electric current, has given place to zinc-coated wire of larger size
and greater conductivity.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘But while the quality of the lines has greatly improved under the experienced
and liberal management of the telegraph companies, the cost of constructing
lines has kept pace with the increased cost of everything else, and has more
than doubled within the past six years, so that lines which could have been built
in 1860 for $150 per mile could not now be constructed for <i>twice that amount</i>.
A substantial telegraph line, constructed on the line of a railroad, with <i>cedar</i> or
<i>chestnut</i> poles thirty feet in length, and six inches at the top by twelve at the
butt, set forty to the mile, with most improved form of insulator and best galvanized
wire, would cost $400 per mile for a single wire. If forty-foot poles
were used (which would be necessary if many wires were to be placed upon
one set of poles), it would cost $600 per mile for a single wire. When fifty-foot
poles are used, the cost is very greatly enhanced.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Mr. Brown estimates the total cost of all the telegraph property in the
United States at “a little more than $2,000,000.” Now, if we estimate the
present cost of the lines and their equipment at the moderate price of $300 per
mile, and the number of miles of wire in the country at only 150,000, we have
a total cost of $45,000,000, without reckoning the value of the patents, franchises,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Mr. Brown states that “telegraphs properly constructed, the timber well
prepared and wire protected, will last for 20 years.” This may be true, but it
remains to be proved.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>We fail to discern any refutation by Mr. Prescott of his previous
statements. His reasons for a change in the estimates for building
a telegraph line in 1866 over those of 1860 hardly need be stated.
If the results of the intervening years of civil war, by which a million
of able-bodied men were cut off from the fields of labor, the
industries of the country burdened with enormous taxes before unknown,
and prices inflated by the issue of hundreds of millions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>paper dollars, do not suggest them, there is small hope of profit
from the practical lessons of the times.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>INCORRECT ASSERTION THAT AMERICAN TELEGRAPHS ARE NOT CONSTRUCTED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Washburne says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The officers of the telegraph companies, whose elaborate statement is
also forwarded by the Postmaster-General, estimate as follows:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Cost of construction, including engineering, patents, and franchises, per
mile: one wire—six wires.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘The cost of building lines varies according to locality, timber, method, nature
of the ground, and the wires to be borne.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘A line from New York to Washington should be of the best class, and would
be represented by the following figures:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘The cost of franchises and patents cannot be given.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Such a line built by government, carefully, and with reference to permanence,
with six wires, would cost $250,000.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘If, however, it is seriously contemplated by the government to construct
lines along the great commercial routes, and if it be the design in so doing to
remove from the system, by every attainable appliance or improvement, all its
ascertained defects, a structure of larger poles, and wires of superior conducting
qualities, will be built. Such a line should be constructed of the most solid and
durable wood, such as the black locust, so that masses of sleet or moist snow, so
destructive to present lines, would leave it uninjured. Heavier wires also,
which, by their increased conducting capacity, would give greater facility and
certainty to transmission, should be used.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘These improvements, with greater care taken in the execution of the work
than in that of ordinary structures, will, of course, increase its cost in proportion
to the care bestowed. And should the government determine to provide facilities
equal to those now proffered by private companies, it would be necessary
to erect at least five lines of poles bearing six wires each, that being the number
(thirty in all) now in use between New York and Washington by all the
companies.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“‘A common wire line, intended to bear one, and not more than two wires,
can be built for $150 to $180 per mile, the wire being number nine, galvanized,
the poles of limited size, and costing not over $1.25 each.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“It nowhere appears that such lines as all these writers insist shall be
built by the government have ever been built in this or any other country.
They seem to have taken it as matter of course that the government,
if the experiment proposed should be tried, will depart from the
usual method of construction and build the novel and costly structures
for which their estimates are made. One looks in vain in the communication
sent to Congress by the Postmaster-General for any reliable information
as to the cost of a telegraphic line, constructed as such lines are
in this and other countries, and such a line as the government, if it should
be determined to build an experimental line, would probably build.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>COST OF AMERICAN TELEGRAPHS ESTIMATED BY EUROPEAN DATA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In reply to Mr. Washburne’s statement that no such lines as
all these writers insist shall be built by the government have ever
been built in this or any other country, we respectfully, but firmly,
assert that he is mistaken. This company possesses thousands of
miles of telegraph lines constructed after the specifications given
above, and costing as much as the estimates which he so emphatically
distrusts. In order, however, to set this matter of cost at
rest, we will endeavor to establish it by comparison with those of
all other countries of which we have been able to procure official
data.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Frank Ives Scudamore, one of the assistant secretaries of
the British Post-Office, and the gentleman who furnished the reports
and data by which the British government were induced to
monopolize the telegraph in that country, and who shows no disposition
to overvalue the property or services of private telegraph
companies, testified before the select committee of the House of
Commons, July 9, 1868, that the total number of miles of telegraph
in operation in Great Britain in 1866 was 16,000, and
that the companies expended in constructing the same about
£2,300,000.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. Special Report, Electric Telegraph Bill, ordered by the House of Commons to
be printed, 16 July, 1868. See testimony on pages 149 and 150.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The capital stock of the various companies represented a larger
sum than this, and Mr. Scudamore himself acknowledges that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>has got the amount under the mark rather than over it; therefore
we presume that Mr. Washburne will allow this to be a fair
estimate. Now £2,300,000 sterling is equal to $11,132,000 in
gold, or $16,475,360 in United States legal money. This sum,
divided by 16,000 miles of line, gives us $1,029.71 as the cost
per mile.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Belgian system comprised, at the end of 1866, 3,519 kilometres
of telegraph lines, equal to 2,187 English miles. The cost
of constructing these lines, up to December, 1866, amounted to
2,055,083 francs, equal to $411,016.60 gold, or $608,304.56 currency;
which would give $274.14 for each mile of line. It must
be borne in mind, however, that the Belgian government, owning
all the railroads, could transport all the telegraph material free,
and in many other ways greatly reduce the cost of the lines; of
course the right of way cost them nothing, and with us this is an
important item.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bavaria has 2,115 miles of line, which cost for construction
843,207 florins, equal to $340,092.28 gold, or $503,338.35 in
our currency. This would make the cost per mile $240. The
same conditions, however, which reduced the cost of construction
in Belgium tended to the same result in Bavaria.</p>

<p class='c009'>In France there are 20,028 miles of lines costing 23,800,791
francs, equal to $4,760,158.20 in gold, or $7,045,034.13 in currency,
making the average cost of each mile of line $351.75.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>VALUE OF WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH PROPERTY, BASED ON EUROPEAN DATA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The number of miles of line belonging to this company is
50,760, and the number of miles of wire is 97,416.</p>

<p class='c009'>Taking the average cost per mile of telegraph line in England
as a basis for a calculation of the cost of the lines of the
Western Union Telegraph Company, we have a total value of
$52,166,079.60. If we estimate the cost of our lines by the average
cost of all the telegraph lines in Europe of which any statistics
can be obtained, we have a total value of $31,002,177.60.</p>

<p class='c009'>Much has been said respecting the alleged unreasonably large
capital of the Western Union Telegraph Company. This company
was organized in the year 1851, with a capital of three hundred
and sixty thousand dollars, and constructed a line of electric
telegraph from Buffalo, N. Y., to Louisville, Ky., distance
about six hundred miles. The cost of the line, on a gold
basis, was thus $600 per mile. The present extent of line
belonging to this company, if estimated by the cost of the original
line, and forty per cent be added for the premium on gold,
would give us $42,638,400 as its value. On the basis of the
cost of the lines of the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company,
the capital of the Western Union Telegraph Company would be
about $100,000,000, and, on that of some other rival lines, nearly
$200,000,000.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gross receipts of the Western Union Telegraph Company
from July 1, 1866, to November 1, 1868,—two years
and four months,—were $16,088,498.86, and the gross expenses
$9,862,272.31; leaving $6,226,225.75 as the net earnings, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>an average of over seven per cent per annum on the capital of the
company, which is $40,347,700. After applying $1,934,040.61
of the receipts of the past two years towards the construction of
new lines, and the redemption of the bonds of the company, it has
made, with one exception, regular semiannual dividends of two per
cent. Such a property as this, if situated in England, or any other
country in Europe, would be regarded as so valuable that its
stock would be held at par, and yet it is selling in our markets
at the present time at sixty-four per cent discount, or at thirty-six
dollars per share! At this price the entire property, including
payment of the bonded debt, would only cost $19,415,672.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now what is the explanation of this singular distrust of the value
of this great property as shown by its insignificant present market
value? Less than four years ago the stock sold at above par, and
its earnings and prospects were then inferior to what they are
at the present time. An examination of the tables on page <a href='#Page_39'>39</a>
will show that the gross receipts and net earnings have constantly
increased during the past two and a half years, and there is every
reason, so far as the management and prosperity of the company
is concerned, why its market value should have increased instead
of depreciating. The explanation for this singular state of
things is to be found in the constant agitation in Congress of
various schemes for the construction and operation of government
telegraphs, at prices very much lower than the cost of the service.
Let any industry be thus constantly menaced, and it must necessarily
suffer in public estimation as a safe investment. We trust
the subject will be effectually settled during the present session
of Congress, and the incubus which has so long rested upon this
important enterprise be removed.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ERRONEOUS ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE OF THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY’S PROPERTY.</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Washburne says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The statement furnished by the officers of the telegraph companies, for
the information of the Postmaster-General, and by him forwarded to
Congress as his reply to the call for information, is well calculated to
remove all doubts as to the value of this kind of property. Among other
items of information is the following:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The length of wire owned by the Western Union and United States companies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>is 60,000 miles.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> The average cost, as based on the now united capital,
is $450 per mile. This embraces, besides the poles, wires, and apparatus, the
following:—</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f13'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. This estimate was made before the consolidation of the American Telegraph
Company and other properties with the Western Union Telegraph Company, and
when its capital was only $27,000,000.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is remarkable that while <i>the length of wire</i> is given, the length of
line nowhere appears.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> There is a vast difference between the cost of a
<i>telegraph line</i> and a <i>telegraphic wire</i>. We have seen the cost of a line
with a single wire estimated at $61.80, and each additional wire placed
on the same posts, $31.80 per mile.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f14'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. We have given the length of the lines, as well as the length of the wires belonging
to the Western Union Telegraph Company, on page <a href='#Page_32'>32</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“In the absence of any exact information on the subject, we may fairly
estimate that the lines of the companies named average three wires to
each line. They possess, then, 20,000 miles of telegraph line, with an
average of three wires thereon. They speak of ‘single wire lines costing
$180 per mile.’ This estimate is too high for any line now in use;
but if it be adopted as the basis of calculation, and an allowance of $45
per mile be made for each additional wire, we have, for the 20,000 miles
of line owned by the companies named, a cost of $5,400,000, represented
by a capital stock of $41,000,000! ‘The average cost’ per mile
of each wire suspended on their lines, ‘<i>as based on the now united capital</i>,
is $450 per mile.’ If ‘the united capital’ had been based upon
the actual cost of the property of the company, it would have been nearer
$4,000,000 than $41,000,000.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The ‘information’ furnished to the Postmaster-General is compiled
with the evident intent to discourage the experiment then contemplated.
It is incomplete, and is compiled with an intent to mislead. To any one
who will take the trouble to examine it carefully, and to apply the proper
tests to its assertions, it furnishes additional arguments in favor of a careful
experiment by the government in the construction and maintenance
of telegraph lines under control of the Post-Office Department.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To impugn the motives of an opponent is the weakest of arguments.
If his statements are wrong, it is easy to show wherein,
but wholesale denunciation convinces no one of the strength of
the cause or the culpability of the assailed. We do not question
Mr. Washburne’s honesty of purpose in making his unjust and extremely
erroneous statements regarding the property or executive
ability of the Western Union Telegraph Company, but we do say
that he is most egregiously deceived upon all points which he has
discussed.</p>

<p class='c009'>In reply to the charges which Mr. Washburne brings against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the Western Union Telegraph Company, of compiling information
for the Postmaster-General with an intent to mislead, of exaggerating
the cost of construction of lines, and misrepresenting the value
of its own, we respectfully present the following facts respecting
the organization of the company, the amount of its capital, the
number of miles of line and the number of miles of route, together
with a statement of the number of skilled persons in its employ.</p>

<div class='section'>

<h3 class='c010'>THE ORGANIZATION OF THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY.</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>In the spring of 1866 there were three telegraph companies,
covering vast areas of territory in the United States. Two of
these companies operated lines over separate divisions of the
country, but worked in connection with each other, while the
third, which covered some portions of the territory of the others,
was a competitor for the business of all sections. These three
companies were the Western Union, with lines extending from
New York to California, and throughout the Western States; the
American, with lines extending from the Gulf of the St. Lawrence
to the Gulf of Mexico, and through the lower Mississippi
and Ohio Valleys; and the United States, with lines extending
from Portland, Me., to Richmond, Va., and from New York to
Kansas.</p>

<p class='c009'>The necessity for direct communication between the East and
the West, and the economy of one set of officers and employees
instead of two, demanded the consolidation of the American and
the Western Union; and the still greater saving to all the companies
by the uniting of the lines and offices of the United States
with those of the other two equally necessitated its amalgamation
with the others.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>ENGLISH AND AMERICAN TELEGRAPHS COMPARED.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It has been shown that, several years before there is any record of
regular public telegraph business in continental Europe, the system
in the United States was in popular use. There can be no question
that what restrained its use in Europe for so many years was
governmental jealousy of its power, and not ignorance of its capacity.
The subject was freely canvassed in the public prints, and
was familiar to the learned men of all European nations. Even in
England, whose government aided its introduction through private
enterprise, the employment of the telegraph was hindered by a
tariff so high as to shut it out from general use. Respecting this
latter fact, so as to give in more marked contrast the early history
of the telegraph on the two continents, a few details are given.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Electric Telegraph Company of England was incorporated
in 1846, and seems to have made its first work in the connection of
the railway stations, post-office, police, admiralty, Houses of Parliament,
Buckingham Palace, &amp;c. As late as 1851 only eighty
stations in the provinces, including the chief cities and outposts,
had been opened. Priority of service was secured to the government,
and the Secretary of State was empowered, on extraordinary
occasions, to take possession of all telegraph stations and hold them
for a week, with power to continue so to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tariff of charges adopted was, for twenty words, including
address and signature, one penny per mile for the first fifty miles;
one half-penny for the second fifty; and one farthing for any
distance beyond 100 miles. The lowest charge was 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, sterling.
This tariff existed as late as 1851. Compare these rates
with those of the American lines at the same period.</p>

<p class='c009'>From London to York, a distance of about 230 miles, the charge
was 9<i>s.</i>, equal to $2.25 gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>From New York to Boston, a distance of 220 miles, the tariff for
ten words, exclusive of address and signature, was twenty cents!</p>

<p class='c009'>From London to Edinburgh, a distance of about 400 miles, the
charge was 13<i>s.</i>, or $3.25, while from New York to Buffalo, 500
miles, the charge was forty cents. On the English tariff of charges,
a message from New York to New Orleans would have been
$11.46; the actual tariff was $2.50.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>ACKNOWLEDGED SUPERIORITY OF THE EARLY AMERICAN SERVICE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>On this subject we have the testimony of one of the best of
British popular publications,—“Chambers’s Papers for the People,”
published in 1851,—whose words we quote:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“The scale of charges in the United States is much lower than
in this country; the electric telegraph is consequently more available
to the greater part of the population engaged in commercial
affairs. Apart from business and politics, the Americans have
made the telegraph subservient to other uses; medical practitioners
in distant towns have been consulted, and their prescriptions transmitted
along the wire; and a short time since a gallant gentleman
in Boston married a lady in New York by telegraph,—a process
which may supersede the necessity for elopement, provided the law
hold the ceremony valid. A favorable idea of the immediate practical
utility of the telegraph may be gathered from a communication to the
present writer from New York. ‘The telegraph,’ he writes, ‘is used
in this country by all classes except the very poorest, the same as
the mail. The most ordinary messages are sent in this way,—a
joke, an invitation to a party, an inquiry about health, &amp;c. At
the offices they are accommodating, and will inquire about messages
that have miscarried or have not been answered, without
extra charge.’ The lines in the United States are carried across
the country regardless of travelled thoroughfares; over tracts of
sand and swamp, through the wild primeval forest where man has
not yet begun his contest with nature, where even the rudiments
of civilization are yet to be learned. Away it stretches, the metallic
indicator of intellectual supremacy, traversing regions haunted by
the rattlesnake and the alligator, solitudes that re-echo with nocturnal
howlings of the wolf and the bear. Communications are
maintained from North to South, East and West, through all the
length and breadth of the mighty Union, and with a frequency
and social purpose exceeding that of any other nation. In one
stretch, Maine and Vermont, where winter with deepest snows and
arctic temperature usurps six months of the year, are united with
the lands of the tropics, where the magnolia blooms and palm-trees
grow in perpetual summer. Subordinate lines bring the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>lakes—the inland seas—into direct communication with the
ocean ports on the eastern shore. Nothing stops the restless, enterprising
spirit of that people.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>REMARKABLY LOW TARIFFS OF THE EARLY AMERICAN TELEGRAPHS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There is, indeed, nothing more remarkable respecting the presentation
of any great invention to the public than the fact that the
electric telegraph in America was thrown open to the public, in its
very inception, at the lowest tariff which has yet, under all the
excitement of opposition, been adopted.</p>

<p class='c009'>What was true of Great Britain with respect to tariffs during
the early years of the introduction of the telegraph applies, as has
been seen, equally to France and the other European states.
Every tariff adopted was, to a large extent, prohibitory, and the
facts connected with these years utterly falsify the statement that
Europe has shown (until within a very few years) anything like
the spirit of liberality which private companies in the United
States have manifested in this matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Since these early years no advance was made in our tariffs until
the third year of the rebellion, when the depreciation of the currency
necessitated the increasing of the salaries of employees from
fifty to one hundred per cent, and enhanced the price of material
in a corresponding ratio, compelling a considerable increase of the
tariff on despatches. Since the war closed, most of the important
tariffs have been reduced to their original standard, without any
corresponding reduction of the price of material or labor.</p>

<p class='c009'>In contrast with this, we need only to point to the large advance
in railway fares and transportation, in the cost of entertainment
at hotels, in the prices of daily newspapers, and in that
of almost every commodity or service which the people enjoy; and
yet the telegraph, like all other enterprises, has been burdened
with the same increase in the cost of labor and materials.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>NO SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TELEGRAPH AND POSTAL SYSTEMS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The idea which has been repeatedly broached, that the telegraph
and postal communication are in the same category, is entirely fallacious.
The telegraph does that which the post cannot do, and
which, before the telegraph was invented, remained undone. If the
public use the telegraph at a cost of 25 cents when they might
use the mail at a cost of three cents, it is obvious that the use of
the telegraph implies something essentially different from the use
of the post. If they use the post, with its tardy departure and delivery,
instead of the telegraph with its instant and continuous
departure and delivery, it is equally obvious that there is something
implied in the use of the post that is not to be obtained by
the use of the telegraph.</p>

<p class='c009'>Postal correspondence and telegraph communication are two
very distinct things.</p>

<p class='c009'>A telegram announces sudden illness; death; an accident;
prices of gold every five minutes; prices of stocks every hour; sudden
fluctuations in the values of commodities; orders rooms at a
hotel, while the sender is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i> and flying to the distant city as
rapidly as steam can carry him; countermands orders and instructions
contained in letters sent by post; orders letters to be returned
unopened; orders the arrest of fugitives from justice after they
have taken their departure on the railway; orders the search for a
package left in the cars, and its return by a succeeding train;
announces that the Merrimac has destroyed several ships of war,
and may get to sea in spite of the Monitor and ravage the coast;
announces that the flag has been fired upon at Charleston, and in
twenty minutes arouses the entire nation. None of these things
are possible for the post. Before a letter could convey the intelligence
of the sudden illness, the patient is dead, or convalescent;
the dead is buried; gold has changed in price a hundred times;
stocks have gone up and down; the man arrives at his hotel twenty-four
hours in advance of his letter; the instructions in the letters have
been acted upon, and no subsequent ones can repair the damage;
the fugitive from justice escapes out of the country; the package
left in the cars is irretrievably lost; the Merrimac has been sent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the bottom, and the alarm caused by the tidings through the post,
which must continue until another arrival, is groundless; and the
flag has been insulted a month, before all the patriots of the country
have heard the tidings by the slow, plodding mail.</p>

<p class='c009'>The telegram is often the index to the more full and copious
information conveyed by the post, but it does not supersede it.
There is no similarity in the conveyance of matter by post or
telegraph.</p>

<p class='c009'>A letter deposited in a post-office is placed in a bag, and carried
to its destination with no less labor and expense than if <i>ten</i> letters
were so deposited. The time taken in transport is the same. A
leather bag covers a thousand letters as easily as a solitary note.
It was this fact which led to the reduction of postage. But it was
accomplished without the loss of an hour to government, without
the enlargement of a coach, or any considerable increase in the
compensation paid for the service. It involved no new brain-labor,
no new responsibilities, no new expense. Under such circumstances
high postage was a folly, and to return to it would be
almost a crime.</p>

<p class='c009'>A communication by telegraph, on the contrary, demands a
calm, unoccupied brain, and a steady hand to manipulate its contents,
letter by letter. A slip of the finger from the manipulating
key changes its meaning; a truant thought alters the manuscript;
a shadow of forgetfulness mars its whole design. It demands a
whole wire for its use, and a given time for its solitary passage.
Hence the necessity for multiplying the wires and enlarging the
operating staff.</p>

<p class='c009'>Added to all this is the necessity for repeating this process when
destined to any point not directly reached by the originating
office.</p>

<p class='c009'>Over and over again have many of the messages left in the hands
of telegraph companies to be translated or re-written before they
reach their destination; very different from the sealed letter, which
needs but the toss of a practised hand to change its route and put
it under the cover of a new bag.</p>

<p class='c009'>The difference between the use of the post and telegraph is well
shown by the practice of the Western Union Telegraph Company,
<i>which requires all of its employees to use the mail, instead of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>telegraph, in every case where the interests of the company will
not suffer by the delay</i>. All check errors, and discrepancies in accounts,
are settled by correspondence through the mail, where the
same might be done more readily, though at far greater expense,
by the use of the wires. Now, if the company owning the lines,
and working them, can better afford to pay the postage on its communications,
than to block up the wires with its own free business, it
shows a very radical difference between the expense of transmitting
matter by steam, or horse-power, and doing the same by electricity.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>COLLECTION AND DELIVERY OF TELEGRAMS BY LETTER-CARRIERS IMPRACTICABLE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The plan proposed for the collection and delivery of telegrams
by letter-carriers is equally impracticable. The rapid
and safe delivery of messages is the great difficulty with which
the telegraph companies have to contend, and the amount paid
for this service forms a very material portion of the expense attending
the operation of the system. How would this service be
performed if left to the Post-Office Department? In 1865—the
last year containing the statistics of the number of letters
sent through the United States mail—the Postmaster-General
estimates the number of letters transmitted at 467,591,600. No
statement of the total number of letters delivered by carrier in the
United States is given in the Postmaster-General’s reports for
1865 or 1866, but he states that the number of cities at which free
delivery is established is 46, and the total number of carriers, 863;
that 582 carriers are attached to ten offices, from which are delivered
38,060,009 letters. If the remaining 281 carriers, who are
distributed among 36 offices, deliver as many in proportion, we
have a total of 56,446,004 letters delivered for the year, or about
nine per cent of the whole number transmitted through the mail.
This does not present a very flattering result, and does not argue
very favorably for the satisfactory delivery of thirteen millions of
telegrams, through the same channel, at over 4,000 offices!</p>

<p class='c009'>Compare with these meagre results the operations of the British
Post-Office, which employs 11,449 carriers, and annually delivers
705,000,000 letters.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for the collection of telegrams from street boxes, the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>idea is in direct antagonism to the first principles of telegraphic
communication. A street box may answer the purpose of a place
of deposit for a letter intended for the next day’s mail, but those
who desire to communicate by telegraph want immediate and
speedy communication. They require their message conveyed,
and very frequently answered, whilst they wait in the telegraph
office. They have no idea of depositing their messages to await
the diurnal collection from the street box. Indeed, the idea is too
absurd to be seriously discussed. There are upwards of 100
telegraph offices in the city of New York alone, and a proportionate
number of branch offices in all the cities. Is it probable that
persons who wish to send a despatch will walk several miles to
send it by government line rather than patronize private lines
at their own doors?</p>

<p class='c009'>We cannot think that a department whose expenses exceed its
receipts by $6,437,991.85 in a single year; which cannot even
<i>guess within a hundred millions</i> of the number of letters it transmits
per annum; which provides only forty-six free delivery offices
out of a total of 29,387 post-offices in the United States; which
does not even pretend to give the number of letters delivered free
for any one year; and which sends over 4,500,000 letters to the
Dead-Letter Office per annum, is a very proper guardian of so important
an interest as the Electric Telegraph.</p>

<p class='c009'>The space occupied for the various telegraph offices in all the
principal cities of the United States is considerably greater than
that required by the post-offices, while the rent paid by our company,
owing to the more central and eligible situations of our
offices, is greatly in excess of that paid by the Post-Office Department.
In New York, our company pays $40,000 per annum
for rent of its central office alone. So far as space and eligibility
of location is concerned, we could much better accommodate the
public by the delivery of their letters at our numerous offices, than
they are now accommodated at the remote and inconvenient places
provided for them by the government, and in all respects we could
much better handle the mails than the post-office, as now located
and generally conducted, could manage the telegraph.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>MR. WASHBURNE’S PROPOSED EXPERIMENTAL LINE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Washburne says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“In the present position of the finances of the country, it would hardly
be wise to enter upon an extended experiment. It should be tried at
first on a limited scale, and at small cost. If it proves successful, and
becomes what the telegraph under other government control has become
in other countries,—a source of revenue, as well as an inestimable boon
to the community,—it ought to be, and doubtless will be, extended. The
amount necessary to construct a suitable line from Washington to New
York, and to sustain it until it becomes self-sustaining, will not exceed
$75,000, and it is the belief of experienced telegraphers that, with a
tariff of charges as low as that of Belgium and Switzerland, and with an
additional charge of single postage upon each message, the line would be
self-sustaining from the beginning, and would probably repay its entire
cost long before the value of the structure was materially impaired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The results of lowering tariffs for telegrams to a point approximating
the charge for letter postage has been tried so often in
this country, as not to require a new demonstration. The following
statement will show the result of a recent trial between the
two important cities of Chicago and Milwaukee.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 12th of August, 1867, a rival line was opened between
those two points, having no connection with any other at either
end. The competition, therefore, was for local business only.
The tariff previously had been sixty cents. The average number
of messages transmitted per day for the ten days preceding the
beginning of business by the new company was sixty-nine, and
the daily receipts fifty-five dollars. On the opening of the rival
line the rate was reduced to forty cents, and the average number
of messages sent by both was eighty-seven, the receipts forty-seven
dollars. On the 16th September the rate was further reduced
to twenty cents, with the following results: Average number
of messages per day for both lines, one hundred and thirty-three.
Average receipts, thirty-seven dollars. On November
8th the rate was reduced to ten cents, and remained so for the
next fourteen days, during which the number of telegrams transmitted
daily by both lines was one hundred and sixty-seven, and
the average receipts twenty-six dollars.</p>

<p class='c009'>About the 20th November the rates were advanced to forty
cents, by mutual agreement, and afterwards the lines and records
of the new company came into our possession.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Statement No. 1 exhibits a comparison for the first ten days of
August, 1867, before the opening of the rival line, and when the
tariff was sixty cents, with the same period in 1868 after the tariff
had been forty cents for nearly a year. Statement No. 2 makes a
similar comparison between the aggregate business of the Western
Union and the competing line for the first fifteen days after the
latter opened in 1867, and the same period in 1868, when, although
the rate was the same, there was no competition. By Table No. 1
it appears that, at a tariff of sixty cents, the number of messages
per day last year was sixty-nine, and the receipts therefor fifty-five
dollars. That during the same period this year, at a reduction
of one third in the tariff, there was an increase of about
thirty-three and one third per cent in the number of messages, but
a loss in revenue of twenty per cent. In other words, our work
has been considerably increased, and our compensation therefor
sensibly diminished. Statement No. 2 shows that last year, under
the stimulus of active competition, and a reduction in rates of
one third, the average number of messages per day for fifteen
days was but four more than for the ten days next preceding. It
also shows that, after the reduced rate had been in operation a
year, and, notwithstanding the fact that the telegraph business in
all sections of the country in the month of August this year was
somewhat larger than last, the average had been increased but
eight messages per day, and this increase was attended by a loss
of over three dollars per day in the revenue.</p>

<p class='c009'>From September 1 to November 3, 1868, the number of
messages transmitted per day between these places was one
hundred four and a quarter, and the average daily receipts
$56.41.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 4th of November another rival line was opened between
Chicago and Milwaukee, but no change in rates was introduced
until the 24th of November. The average number of
messages transmitted per day by the Western Union Telegraph
Company between these places, from the 4th to the 23d of
November, inclusive, was seventy-eight, and the daily receipts
$43.27.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 24th of November the rates were reduced to twenty
cents per message, with the following results: Average number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>messages transmitted per day between Chicago and Milwaukee
by the Western Union Telegraph Company, sixty-eight; average
daily receipts, $24.59.</p>

<p class='c009'>It should be remembered that the business from which these exhibits
are derived is between two of the most important inland
commercial cities in the country. Both are largely interested
in two important branches of commerce,—grain and lumber;
and probably no other points could be selected from which more
reliable results could be obtained.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reason why the Chicago and Milwaukee table is the only
one given to show the results of competition is, that such comparisons
are only valuable when they exhibit the effect upon the
business of both competitors. This is impossible in other cases,
because our opponents will not furnish us with their figures. We
have written to every Telegraph Company in the United States
for such statistics for publication, but none of them has responded
to our request.</p>

<p class='c011'>We copy the following official statement of the London District
Telegraph Company from the Telegraphic Journal, London, July
30, 1864. The capital of the company is £60,000, and the average
cost of telegrams transmitted over its lines, for distances that
cannot exceed ten miles, was 6<i>d.</i>, equal to eighteen cents in our
currency, and yet the loss in four and a half years’ business was

<p class='c009'>Thus it will be seen that Continental Europe, where the telegraphs
are under government control, furnishes but 4,347 offices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>for a population of over 250,000,000, while Great Britain, the
Dominion of Canada, and the United States, where telegraphy has
been left to the control of the people, untrammelled by governmental
interference, monopoly, or restriction, furnish 6,659 offices for
a population of 64,000,000! The number of telegrams transmitted
per annum in Continental Europe is only 12,486,311, while there
were sent by the people of the three countries where it has hitherto
been free from government repression, 18,741,360. The tariff of
charges in Continental Europe averages eighty-one cents per message,
while in the three countries where the people manage the
business it averages but fifty-one cents.</p>

<p class='c009'>Private enterprise alone laid the submarine cables through the
Persian Gulf and Mediterranean Sea, across the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
the Vineyard Sound, the Strait of Florida, the English
Channel, the North Sea, and the German and Atlantic Oceans.</p>

<div class='section'>

<h3 class='c010'>THE TELEGRAPH AND THE PRESS.</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>In nothing, perhaps, is the superiority of private enterprise over
governmental control more strongly marked than in the extraordinary
amount of news furnished to the press of the United States,
as contrasted by the meagre supply of the European journals.</p>

<p class='c009'>By a system of co-operation among the newspapers of the
United States and the Western Union Telegraph Company, the
news of the world is daily furnished to the people of every portion
of this country at a price within the reach of the poorest
citizen.</p>

<p class='c009'>On page <a href='#Page_8'>8</a> we have shown that 294,503,630 words are annually
furnished to the newspapers of the United States, at an
average cost of less than two mills per word. This immense
amount of matter is not transmitted to each newspaper separately,
but through a combination of wires only possible to a vast system
like that owned by the Western Union Telegraph Company, it is
sent to a large number of places simultaneously, with only one
transmission.</p>

<p class='c009'>The newspapers of the United States are associated together on
the co-operative system. There is a general association having its
headquarters in New York, which collects news from every part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of the world; and there are local associations in every section of
the country, which furnish their quota of intelligence to the general
association, and receive in return such news as they require.</p>

<p class='c009'>As an illustration of the manner in which this service is performed,
we will take the State press of New York for an example.
The report is compiled by the agent of the Association for the
various editions of the newspapers requiring it, and it is then
handed to the telegrapher, who with the manipulation of his
magic key transmits it simultaneously to Poughkeepsie, Hudson,
Albany, Troy, Utica, Syracuse, Auburn, Elmira, Binghamton,
Owego, Rome, Oswego, Rochester, and Buffalo, New York, to
Rutland and Burlington, Vermont, and to Scranton, Pennsylvania.
These stations are not all on a single wire, nor on the same route,
and the question may be asked, How can they all receive the same
information from a single impulse? This is accomplished by a
combination of circuits through an instrument called a repeater,
by which the intelligence can be transmitted to a thousand offices
as easily as to one.</p>

<p class='c009'>The news is sent to the Eastern press in a similar manner. The
manipulation of the key at New York transmits the report simultaneously
to Bridgeport, New Haven, Hartford, Waterbury, and
Norwich, Conn., Providence, R. I., and to Springfield, Worcester,
Boston, Fall River and New Bedford, Mass.</p>

<p class='c009'>The operator at each of these places receives the reports by the
click of the instruments,—reading by the sound of the armature,—and
with an agate pen copies them upon manifold paper,
making as many impressions as are necessary to furnish each paper
with a duplicate copy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Direct wires carry and bring news from and to Chicago, Cincinnati,
St. Louis, Washington, New Orleans, Plaister Cove, and
other important points. Sixteen wires work out of New York
every night to transmit or receive news reports, and all over the
United States the ubiquitous iron threads are permeated by the
subtile and invisible fluid during all the silent hours of the night,
conveying intelligence of passing events in all sections of the
civilized world for publication in the morning journals throughout
the country.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a singular and suggestive fact, that the amount of news
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>which we furnish to the press of the United States, for an
aggregate sum of $521,509, is considerably greater than the
entire telegraphic correspondence of Continental Europe, for
which the paternal governments of those enlightened and enterprising
peoples receive $11,597,632.71.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following table will serve to show the remarkable contrast,
in this respect, between the systems under government and private
control. The number of messages delivered to the press are
obtained for this comparison by dividing the total number of
words furnished to the press by 20, the European standard:—</p>

<p class='c009'>The above exhibit illustrates the difference between what can
be accomplished under a popular government which leaves the
press and telegraph free and untrammelled, and the results of the
paternal system which the governments of Continental Europe impose
upon their subjects. For these great benefits the people of this
country are indebted to the government for the one negative quality
of letting the press and telegraph alone. For the positive quality
which actually provides them they are solely indebted to the enterprise
and public spirit of the press, and the Western Union Telegraph
Company, the latter furnishing the reports at a price which
barely covers the cost of service employed in transmitting them,
and leaving nothing to defray the expense of the wear of the lines,
or interest on the investments for their construction.</p>

<p class='c009'>In no other country in the world is there such a system, and in
none can there ever be, until the policy of our government is
imitated, and the people left to manage their own private affairs,
leaving the press and the telegraph free and untrammelled by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>governmental control or repression. What our government, with
such an example already set, might be able or disposed to do,
in the event of its monopolizing the telegraphs, it is impossible to
say; but it is unquestionably true, that no other government has
ever made such a use of them to promote the education and general
well-being of its people.</p>

<p class='c009'>We believe it would prove a serious misfortune to the press and
the people, if the government were to destroy, by its interference,
this admirable co-operative system of obtaining telegraphic news at
such low rates.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tariff for special press reports is as follows: For the first
one hundred words, full rates; for the next four hundred words,
a discount of thirty-three and one third per cent; for the next
five hundred words, one half the ordinary tariff; and all over one
thousand words, a discount is made of sixty-six and two thirds per
cent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Washburne’s bill provides for a general tariff of one cent
per word for telegrams, with an additional charge of three cents
for postage, and two cents for delivery, and stipulates that a reduction
of not more than fifty per cent shall be made for press
reports. <i>This rate would increase the average cost of news for the
press of the United States more than three hundred per cent, and
thus the newspapers would be compelled to pay an extra tax of a
million dollars per annum for the privileges they now enjoy.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>If these facts show any results to warrant governmental assumption
or interference in the business of telegraphing, we fail to perceive
them.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>REVIEW<br /> <span class='small'>OF</span><br /> <span class='large'>MR. GARDINER G. HUBBARD’S LETTER TO THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL ON THE EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN SYSTEMS OF TELEGRAPH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We have recently received a pamphlet from Gardiner G. Hubbard,
Esq., of Boston, entitled a “Letter to the Postmaster-General
on the European and American Systems of Telegraph, with
Remedy for the present High Rates,” which we will briefly review.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hubbard commences by saying:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The reasons that have induced the public to commit to the
government the transmission of the mails by rail have induced
most civilized nations to intrust it with the duty of transmitting
correspondence by telegraph. England and America are the only
important exceptions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As England and America are the only “civilized nations”
where the public have any control of such matters, there need be
no further discussion of this proposition.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ERRONEOUS STATEMENTS RELATIVE TO BELGIAN TELEGRAPHS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Alluding to the Belgian telegraph, Mr. Hubbard says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“In 1850 the private lines then in operation were purchased by
the government, and have since been under its management.
The rates were originally one franc and a half for a message of
twenty words. At these rates, the telegraph was little used for
inland messages, and its development was very slow. In January,
1863, they were reduced to one franc, and December, 1865,
to half a franc.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By referring to the official tables published by the Belgian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>government, on page <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>, it will be seen that the average cost per
message on the Belgian lines in 1851 and 1852 was over 6 francs;
in 1853, 5.10 francs; 1854 and 1855, over 4 francs; in 1856 and
1857, 3.62 and 3.42 francs; from 1858 to 1862, over 2 francs;
and even in 1867 they averaged 0.85 francs.</p>

</table>

<p class='c009'>By an examination of Table H, page <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>, it will be seen that
the total receipts of the Belgian telegraphs for 1866 were 962,213
francs; expenditures, 1,217,496 francs; loss, 255,283 francs. Of
the receipts only 407,532 francs were for inland messages, of which
there were transmitted 692,536, while 553,580 francs were received
for 435,469 international and transit messages. As before
stated, the expense of service upon transit messages is merely
nominal. They simply pass through the kingdom, and require no
labor in receiving, transmitting, or delivery. The greater part of
the expense, therefore, was incurred upon the inland messages;
and, had not the Belgian administration imposed a tax upon neighboring
nations of 553,580 francs for messages coming from or going
to other countries, there would have been a deficit of 809,964
francs on the year’s business instead of 255,283 francs.</p>

<p class='c009'>We quote from Mr. Hubbard:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“A system of railroads is also owned and operated by the government,
and the telegraph is connected with both the railroad and
the post. A large proportion of the offices are at the railway
stations, but every post-office is an office of deposit, from which
messages are despatched at once, free of charge, to the nearest
telegraph office, when in the same district; otherwise, by the first
messenger or by special carrier, on payment of an extra rate for
porterage. This union of the telegraph with the post and railroad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>reduces the expenses for operators, clerks, general management,
rent and office expenses, and brings the system into close connection
with every citizen.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The rates are prepaid by stamps, and are uniform and low.
The rate for all inland messages by telegraph, or by telegraph and
post where the place of deposit or delivery is not on the line of the
telegraph, is one half-franc [or thirteen and a half cents currency].”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>BELGIAN TELEGRAMS DELIVERED BY POST.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In reply to this flattering picture of the Belgian system of telegraphy
we quote the following from a recent English publication:<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. Government and the Telegraphs. London, 1868.</p>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“The government of Belgium not only have a monopoly of the
telegraphs and post-office, but also of most of the railways of the
country. They work the system as a whole. In the case of
ordinary half-franc telegrams, the messages are not uniformly despatched
by messenger from the office at which they arrive, <i>but
are sent to the residence of the receiver by post</i>!</p>

<p class='c018'>“The administration of the Belgian telegraph in no respect holds
itself responsible for the delivery of a message, unless it is specially
insured and additionally paid for. They decline all responsibility
on account of delay in the transmission or non-arrival of a half-franc
telegram. <i>They will not even inquire into the cause of delay
of a half-franc telegram!</i> No matter how long a message has taken
in delivery, or whatever may be the errors in it, the government
will make no compensation to the sender or receiver, except under
very exceptional circumstances. Moreover, the twenty words forwarded
for half a franc includes addresses both of sender and
receiver, ‘all of which is free in this country.’”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>WANT OF UNIFORMITY IN RATES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>We quote from Mr. Hubbard:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is no uniformity in the rates. They are often less to a
distant station than to an intermediate one on the same line. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>estimate of the average rates, and of the annual number of messages
transmitted has been made by ascertaining the rates to seventy-one
stations at different distances from Boston, and arranging
them in four different classes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hubbard groups his American distances into classes of
500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 miles; while his English classes
embrace those of 100 and under, 200 and under; over 200,

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hubbard says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“As rates are higher in America, a greater proportion of messages
are sent to stations in class A than in England, and a smaller
proportion to class D. The average receipt per message, at these
rates, is $1.00. The gross receipts of the Western Union Company,
for the year ending the 30th of June, 1868, were $6,952,273.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
This sum, divided by the average receipts, gives the whole number
of messages transmitted, viz. 6,952,000.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f16'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. This amount embraces the total revenue of the Western Union Telegraph Company
for that year, and includes the receipts for telegrams, press reports, and from all
other sources.</p>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“It may be objected that those estimates are incorrect, and therefore
the deductions are unreliable. If the Western Union Telegraph
Company furnish a statement of messages annually transmitted,
the required corrections will be made. If it is not given,
it will be because the estimates of the average rates are too low,
and the deductions too favorable to that company.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. The statement on page <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>, of the number of messages annually transmitted by
this company, shows that Mr. Hubbard’s estimate gives less than 70 per cent of the
number actually sent over the wires. The average rate per message in the United
States is fifty-seven cents.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As the average of these English rates is a little over 75 cents,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>while the greatest distance for the highest English class is less
than for the shortest American class, which he averages at 41 cents,
we do not see how he can assert that the American rates are
higher than the English!</p>

<p class='c009'>In answer to the charge of want of uniformity in the tariffs, we
would call attention to the fact, that the lines under our control
were constructed by a great number of separate organizations,
having tariffs upon all bases, which had to be added together at
all the termini of two or more lines, so that a message going a few
hundred miles would require the payment sometimes of two or
three rates. For instance, a few years since there were five telegraph
companies owning the lines connecting Portland, Maine,
with Cleveland, Ohio, and the tariff between these two places was
ascertained by the addition of the local rates from Portland to
Boston, Boston to Springfield, Springfield to Albany, Albany to
Buffalo, and from Buffalo to Cleveland. The same system prevailed
throughout the United States, until after the consolidation
of the lines made it possible to transmit messages between places
thousands of miles apart without the necessity of booking or
rechecking at intermediate points. This result necessitated a
remodelling of the tariffs, and the work has been going on uninterruptedly
ever since; but when it is considered that a complete
revision of the system required a separate tariff-sheet to be made
out for over three thousand offices, changing and equalizing the
rates to more than three thousand other offices, the immense labor
and responsibility incurred in the undertaking may be imagined.
It was impossible to effect this revision at once with any number
of clerks, and for obvious reasons only a limited number could be
employed upon it, as they can only act under the instruction of
the executive officers, who are charged with all the other duties of
an extensive organization.</p>

<p class='c009'>Various plans have been suggested for simplifying and equalizing
the tariffs, but difficulties of a practical nature present themselves
in all of them. The existence of rival lines, built by speculators
whose profit is in the construction of them, and which
essay to do business at rates less than the cost of the service,
necessitates the reduction of our rates along certain routes disproportionately,
and prevents the adoption of a general rate strictly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>proportioned to distance. In the course of the coming year, however,
it is expected that the work of revising our whole tariff system
will be accomplished, to the satisfaction of all.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ASSERTION THAT COMMERCIAL MESSAGES ARE TRANSMITTED AT A LOSS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hubbard’s assertion that the lowest rate between any large
cities in America is 25 cents is incorrect. The tariff between
Washington and Baltimore is 10 cents; between New York and
Providence, New Haven, Hartford, &amp;c., 20 cents.</p>

<p class='c009'>If it is true, as he states, that “at these rates, under the present
system, commercial messages are probably transmitted at a loss,”
it may be a matter of regret to the stockholders of the telegraph
companies, but affords no just ground for governmental interference.
Besides, how will his proposed corporation be able to
make money by doing the business at a still lower rate?</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hubbard says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The history of the telegraph will explain the causes of these different
rates. Great competition, in 1852, caused a large reduction
in the rates. Soon after the validity of Mr. Morse’s patent was
confirmed by the courts many of the competing companies were
enjoined and compelled to wind up or sell out, and some failed.
In the Eastern and Southern States the American Telegraph
Company, in which Mr. Morse and his friends were largely interested,
bought out most of the old companies, and continued to
occupy their territory for many years without serious opposition.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The various companies in the West, South, and Northwest
(forming groups of feeble organization) were gradually merged
into one corporation, under the name of the Western Union Telegraph
Company. In 1864, the United States Telegraph Company
was organized to oppose this monopoly, and entered into a vigorous
competition with the Western Union; prices were reduced in
consequence, and the business increased with great rapidity. In
1866 the American Telegraph Company, the United States Telegraph
Company, and the Western Union were united under the
corporate name of the last corporation; the prices were again
raised, and this first caused a less ratio of increase, and finally an
actual decrease in the telegraphic business of the country.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Mr. Hubbard’s pamphlet contains a statement of the rates between
New York and Boston in former years which is inaccurate.
The following is a correct table of the rates between those cities

<h3 class='c010'>CORRECTION OF ERRONEOUS STATEMENTS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The statement that “soon after the validity of the Morse patent
was confirmed by the courts in 1852 many of the competing
companies were enjoined and compelled to wind up or sell out”
is incorrect, as is also the assertion that “the American Telegraph
Company bought out most of the old companies, and continued to
occupy their territory for many years without serious opposition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The validity of the Morse patent was never disputed. In 1849
the Morse patentees commenced suits against the New York and
New England [Bain] Telegraph Company, and the New York and
Boston [House printing] Telegraph Company, for an infringement
of the Morse patent. The case against the company using
the Bain patent never came to trial, while the other was decided
in favor of the defendant, by Judge Woodbury of the United
States Supreme Court, 1850.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. For an abstract of this decision see “Prescott’s History, Theory, and Practice of
the Electric Telegraph.” Boston: Fields, Osgood, &amp; Co.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The consolidations between competing lines, in 1852 and 1853,
was caused by the inability of the companies under separate organizations
to meet their working expenses. They were generally
confined, however, to the union of the Morse and Bain lines, and
there still remained two competing lines upon all the principal
routes. There has never been but a single year, since 1849, when
there have not been at least two competing lines between Boston
and Washington.</p>

<p class='c009'>The American Telegraph Company was not organized until
1855, and it was not consolidated with any opposition line until
1860. The next year after the consolidation the Independent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Company built a competing line between New York and Portland,
Maine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The assertion that “the United States Telegraph Company was
organized to oppose this monopoly, and entered into a vigorous
competition with the Western Union, and that prices were reduced
in consequence,” is also incorrect. The United States
Telegraph Company never reduced the rates at any point. On
the contrary, it was not until after the United States’ lines were
put in operation that the rates were advanced. This was rendered
necessary by the great depreciation of our currency, and consequent
advance in the cost of labor and materials for working the
lines, and was done by agreement of all the companies.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>TARIFFS NOT INCREASED BY CONSOLIDATION OF THE LINES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The statement that, after the consolidation of the American,
United States, and Western Union Telegraph Companies, in 1866,
“the prices were again raised, and this first caused a less ratio of
increase, and finally an actual decrease in the telegraphic business
of the country,” is without the least foundation in fact. In no instance
has the tariff been increased since the consolidation. On
the contrary, there has been a steady decrease, the rates to more
than one thousand stations having been lowered since the consolidation;
and this course is still being pursued as rapidly as a
just regard to the rights of the stockholders and the extremely
complicated nature of adjustment to be made will allow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The impression which Mr. Hubbard attempts to give, that the
consolidation of the companies forming the Western Union Telegraph
Company, included all the lines, and gave this company a
monopoly of the business, is also incorrect. The Franklin Company,
between Boston and New York, the Insulated Company,
between Boston and Washington, the Bankers and Brokers’, between
New York and Washington, and others, were then in
active operation, and are still.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hubbard says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“In other countries, the rates are reduced with the growth of
business, and are never raised. In this country, they are reduced
by competition, followed by consolidation of the competing companies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>and subsequent increase of rates, without regard to the
growth of the business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The rates are unquestionably often reduced by competition,
sometimes below the cost of doing the business, and this will
always be the case as long as men will listen to the plausible
schemes of speculative enthusiasts, and invest their money in new
lines in the hope of realizing profits which are never earned. The
assertion, however, that consolidation is followed by an increase of
rates, without regard to the growth of the business, is not warranted
by the facts.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ERRONEOUS ASSERTION THAT A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE OFFICES ARE AT RAILROAD STATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>We quote from Mr. Hubbard again:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The telegraph in this country is very generally connected
with the railroad system, and a large proportion of the offices are
at railroad stations.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> These are seldom in the centre of the
towns, and are not resorted to as generally as the post-office.
In the large cities, the principal offices are near the business
centres, with a number of secondary offices, generally at hotels
and railroad stations. The rent of the main offices is very large,
and the expenses for operators, clerks, and managers are also
necessarily much more than when the telegraph is connected
with the post.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. By a singular coincidence, Mr. Scudamore makes the same complaint against the
English companies, and in nearly the same words. See Scudamore’s Letter to the
Postmaster-General, London, 1868.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is true that many telegraph offices are connected with the
railroad system in this country, as well as abroad. Indeed, no railroad
would be considered complete without such a connection, but
it is not true that a large proportion of the offices are at the railroad
stations.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have shown on page <a href='#Page_8'>8</a> that the telegraph system of Europe
is not specially connected with the Post-Office Department. In
some countries the telegraph, post-office, and railway systems are
under one department, but there is no particular connection between
them. The post-offices are merely offices of deposit for
telegrams, and not for transmission. But supposing they were
united, why should the expenses of operators, clerks, and managers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>be necessarily much less than when the telegraph is worked separately?
We presume he does not propose to dispense with the
operators, and put the telegrams in the mail-bag; or does he propose
that when the government gets control of the telegraph that
the salaries will be reduced? If this is his idea, we think he is
reckoning on a false hope, for if there was an attempt of this
nature, the operators would seek some other employment.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN TELEGRAPH TARIFFS COMPARED.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hubbard says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The lowest American rates are higher than the average foreign
rates, and the average rates several times higher than the
foreign. These high rates retard the development of the system,
which was more rapid in its early growth in this than in any other
country. What are the reasons assigned for these high rates?
Are they well founded, and if not, how can they be obviated?”</p>

<p class='c009'>These assertions are entirely erroneous, and the facts quite the
reverse. <i>The highest American rates are lower than the highest
foreign rates; the average American rates are lower than the average
foreign rates; and the lowest American rates are lower than
the lowest foreign rates.</i> The lowest rate given in Europe is half
a franc, about equal to 14⅘ cents in currency, while our rate between
Baltimore and Washington is only 10 cents. In Paris the
tariff on city messages is half a franc (14⅘ cents), and in London,
for city messages, 6<i>d.</i> sterling, equal to 18 cents in our currency;
while the rates for New York, from the Battery to Harlem River,
are only 10 cents.</p>

<p class='c009'>In order that a fair comparison may be made between the
American and European systems of telegraphy, so far as the rate
of charges is concerned, we present a list of sixty of the principal
stations in Europe, and the same number in the United States,
with the tariffs and distances in air lines from London and New
York respectively, together with the rules and regulations of each
system.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>RULES OF THE EUROPEAN TELEGRAPHS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The minimum charge is for a message
of twenty words, including the address
and signature, and half price is charged
for each ten or fraction of ten words above
twenty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Words of seven or less syllables count
as one word. In words containing more
than seven, the overplus counts as <i>one</i>
word; each word <i>underlined</i> counts as
<i>three</i> words.</p>

<p class='c009'>Messages containing the same subject-matter
addressed to different stations are
charged as separate messages.</p>

<p class='c009'>Secret or cipher messages can be sent
by government only.</p>

<p class='c009'>Replies at full rates can be prepaid; but
should the reply contain more than the
number of words specified and paid for,
the sender of the reply must pay for the
excess as a fresh message.</p>

<p class='c009'>Messages can be repeated by payment
of double charge at the time they are sent,
the words “Repetition paid” being inserted
after receiver’s address, and charged
for.</p>

<p class='c009'>All complaints respecting irregularity
in the transmission or delivery of messages
must be made by <span class='fss'>THE SENDER</span>, and
in cases of delay or error the complaint
must invariably be accompanied by the
<span class='fss'>RECEIVER’S COPY</span> of the message. Complaints
from the receivers of messages will
not be entertained.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>RULES OF THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The minimum tariff is for a message of
ten words. No charge is made for address,
signature, or date. After the first ten words
the rate is so much per word, the amount
being proportional to the rate for the first
ten.</p>

<p class='c009'>All words are counted as one which
are found so written in the dictionaries.
No extra charge is made for messages
written in cipher, and no restrictions are
placed upon their transmission.</p>

<p class='c009'>Replies can be prepaid if desired, and
no charge is made for inserting this information
in the sender’s message.</p>

<p class='c009'>Messages can be repeated by the payment
of one half the regular charge in
addition, and the company agrees to be
responsible for any mistakes which may
occur in repeated messages, to the amount
of fifty times the sum received for sending
the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>Correctness in the transmission of messages
to any point on the lines of this
company can be <span class='fss'>INSURED</span> by contract in
writing, stating agreed amount of risk,
and payment of premium thereon at the
following rates, in addition to the usual
charge for repeated messages, viz.: one
per cent for any distance not exceeding
one thousand miles, and two per cent for
any greater distance. No employee of
the company is authorized to vary the
foregoing.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>MORE ERRONEOUS STATEMENTS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hubbard’s assertion that, “where a message is repeated, the
expense is increased about seventy-five per cent, but on well-constructed
lines, in ordinary weather, messages between any two stations
east of a line from St. Paul to New Orleans require but one
repetition,” hardly needs refutation. East of the line named there
are more than four thousand telegraph offices, and at least 1,300
separate and distinct circuits. How, then, can separate wires be
maintained between every two stations over this vast territory?
Even confining the statement to one office at the East,—say Boston,
for example,—how is it possible to maintain separate circuits
that will enable that office to work direct with each one of four
thousand offices? It would be more practicable to travel from
every town in the United States to every other town, without
change of cars, than it would to establish <i>direct</i> telegraphic connection
between each.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Western Union Telegraph Company maintains independent
circuits, and works direct between New York and Philadelphia,
Washington, Boston, Buffalo, Montreal, Chicago, Cincinnati, New
Orleans, Portland, Plaister Cove, and many other points; but to
work with every office in the United States without repetition
would require more wires upon each pole than the mythical Briareus
had hands.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>SINGULAR NOTIONS OF PRACTICAL TELEGRAPHY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It seems scarcely worth while to follow Mr. Hubbard in his
statements regarding the capital of the Western Union Telegraph
Company, and the cost of its lines. We have given a statement
on pages <a href='#Page_37'>37</a> to <a href='#Page_40'>40</a> of the organization of this company, the amount
of its capital, length of lines, and other matters of interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hubbard’s statement that the directors of the Western
Union Telegraph Company have steadfastly refused to reduce rates
until forced by competition, and then consolidated with the competing
company, and again raised the rates, is without the slightest
foundation in fact. We have previously stated that no increase
in the rates has been made since the consolidation with the
United States and American companies, but, on the contrary, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>have been reduced to more than one thousand stations, while the
opposition have less than three hundred offices all told.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ABSURD THEORIES REGARDING THE WORKING CAPACITY OF TELEGRAPH LINES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hubbard says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“The capacities of the line of telegraph are very great.
2,000 words an hour are easily transmitted by a good operator
over a single wire. At this rate there could be sent over fifty-one
of the eighty or ninety wires leading from the New York
office of the Western Union Telegraph Company 2,448,000 words,
or 97,920 messages of twenty-five words each, a day. This amount
cannot be obtained. Forty messages an hour are easily transmitted
by a good operator over a through line, and this number could be
sent every hour by relays of operators. This estimate gives
1,224,000 words, or 48,960 messages. On through and local lines
a deduction of one half for twelve hours of the day, during which
the local lines are open, must be made,—918,000 words, or
36,720 messages, on through and local lines. The average number
actually transmitted on these fifty-one wires is 184,378 words,
or 7,375 messages. 733,622 more words, or 29,340 more messages
might daily be transmitted over these lines. If the present
business could be distributed over all the hours of the day, or if
there were sufficient business for all the wires the whole day, the
rates could be largely reduced.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Nearly eighteen hours of each day the wires are idle, yet a
considerable portion of the expenses of the line are no greater than
they would be if messages were transmitted the whole time. Interest,
depreciation, and repairs, office rent, salaries, and general
management are the same, whether much or little business is transacted.
These items constitute about one third of all the expenses
on the Western Union line. The other expenses will not be increased
in proportion to the increase of the time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In reply to the above, we assert that 2,000 words an hour are
not easily transmitted by a good operator over a single wire.
There are operators who can send at this rate for a short time, but
they are very few in number, and none of them could maintain
this rate of speed for any length of time. It must be recollected
that a message must be copied with a pen as rapidly as it is
sent. Now, we doubt if Mr. Hubbard even can write 2,000
words legibly within an hour, with pen and ink. It is well known
that the celebrated horse Dexter has trotted a mile in the unprecedented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>time of 2.17, but would it not be absurd to state, on
that account, that every good horse can easily trot twenty-six miles
an hour? Why, Dexter himself cannot keep up this rate of speed
for even a quarter of an hour. Because a celebrated pedestrian
walked a hundred miles in twenty-four hours, would it be just to
say that every good walker can easily walk 36,500 miles per
annum? A man in California rode three hundred miles in
twenty-four hours; would it be honest, therefore, to say that every
good horseman can easily ride 9,000 miles a month? The
maximum speed of the best operators is 1,500 words per hour, but
the average speed of the best is very much below this.</p>

<p class='c009'>The amount of business done upon a wire in a given time is
vastly greater in this country than in any other. In Europe there
are 355,218 miles of wire, while in the United States there are
less than one third as many, and yet the wires in this country
transmit more telegraphic matter per annum than all the lines in
Europe. This almost incredible fact is explained by the superior
character and ability of our operating staff. In Europe they still
use recording instruments, and slowly and laboriously pick out
their messages upon strips of paper. Here, on the contrary, every
operator—except in the small villages—reads by sound, and
does three times as much work upon a wire as the poorly paid and
inefficient European operator. Now, this being the case,—and the
statistics prove it,—it can hardly be pretended that our company
gets much less out of its wires than they can reasonably perform,
and yet Mr. Hubbard says we “could easily send on fifty-one
wires 97,920 messages per day, while in reality we only send
7,375.” Here is a difference between theory and practice that
beats even Dexter’s 2.17 as the rate of speed which every
horse in America can average.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>IMPOSSIBILITY OF UTILIZING THE TELEGRAPH LINES BY NIGHT AS WELL AS DAY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hubbard says, “If the present business could be distributed
over all the hours of the day, or if there were sufficient
business for all the wires the whole day, the rates could be largely
reduced”; but neither of these propositions can be realized. The
telegraph is an errand-boy which every one uses when the exigency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>requires it, and which no one will use unnecessarily, even
though it work for nothing. In order to utilize the wires during
those portions of the day and night when they are comparatively
idle, the Western Union Telegraph Company adopted the following
rates for night messages:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“This company will transmit messages between the principal
cities on its lines east of St. Louis and New Orleans, both inclusive,
during the night, and deliver the same the succeeding
morning, on the following terms: For a message of 20 words or
less, the usual tolls on a ten-word message will be charged. For a
message of more than 20 words, and not exceeding 60 words, twice
the usual tolls on a ten-word message will be charged. For a
message of more than 60 words, and not exceeding 120 words,
three times the usual tolls on a ten-word message will be charged.
For each additional 100 words, or part thereof, in excess of 120
words, the usual tolls on a ten-word message will be charged in
addition. Such messages will be known as <span class='fss'>NIGHT MESSAGES</span>.
They will be received for transmission at any time during the day
or evening, and will be sent during the succeeding night. <i>No
additional charge will be made for cipher messages.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>The very moderate success of our night-message experiment,
notwithstanding the large inducements offered, proves that the use
of the telegraph is required not merely for communication, but for
emergency and despatch. It is also a fact worthy of notice, that
very little of this business is done between Boston, New York,

<p class='c009'>Our night-message experiment has proved that the telegraph
will not be used at night, at any tariff, except to a moderate extent
and between distant points.</p>

<p class='c009'>The absurdity of placing the telegraph and postal systems in the
same category has been fully shown on pages <a href='#Page_43'>43</a> and <a href='#Page_44'>44</a>. Mr.
Hubbard appears to have read Mr. Scudamore’s charges against
the English system, and applied them literally to the telegraphs of
this country. Unfortunately, however, charges which may be
true as applied to the companies operating the telegraphs in the
United Kingdom have no pertinency when reproduced as the shortcomings
of the American system.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PROPOSED INCORPORATION OF THE UNITED STATES POSTAL TELEGRAPH COMPANY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hubbard says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is not considered expedient either for the government to
purchase the existing lines, or to construct and operate lines. How,
then, can the desired results be best attained? The Post-Office
Department has no facilities of its own for the transmission of correspondence
either by rail or telegraph. It contracts with the
railroad companies for carrying the mail, and it is proposed that it
shall contract with a telegraph company for transmitting messages.</p>

<p class='c018'>“A bill was introduced at the last session of Congress, and referred
to the committee on Post Roads and Routes, to incorporate
the ‘United States Postal Telegraph Company, and to establish a
postal system.’</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“The first, second, third, fourth, and fifth sections of the bill incorporate
the company, with power to construct lines on all the
post roads and routes of the country.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The sixth section authorizes the Postmaster-General to receive
bids from any telegraph company for the transmission by telegraph
of messages received and delivered through the post-office, to all
cities and villages of 5,000 inhabitants and over, and to towns on
the line of the telegraph, where stations may be established by
order of the Postmaster-General.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The seventh section authorizes the Postmaster-General to contract
for the transmission by telegraph of messages with the company
that will engage to transmit them for the least sum, provided
such sum does not exceed twenty-five cents, including five cents
postage for each message of twenty words, including date, address,
and signature, for each and every 500 miles or fractional part thereof
the message may be transmitted, with five cents for each added
five words. All messages to be prepaid by stamps, or written on
stamped paper.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Messages to be received at any and all post-offices, street-boxes,
or other receptacles for letters, and to be delivered by special carrier
without extra expense.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Messages requiring immediate despatch to have priority of
transmission on payment of extra rates.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The effect of the proposed reduction will be better appreciated
by comparing the present and proposed rates.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>MESSAGES DELIVERED WITHIN A MILE OF THE OFFICE FREE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The rule was established coincident with the introduction of
the telegraph in the United States to deliver all messages in the
town within a mile of the receiving office free. Special and free
delivery should be the rule as far as practicable. And yet it is
impossible, without rendering the telegraph of no avail in important
emergencies, to establish free delivery everywhere. A
message from an Eastern city to a Western village announcing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>peril, disaster, or death is addressed to a person two or three
miles from the telegraph station. The charge for transmitting
this message is, say, fifty cents. Two modes of delivery are
presented,—one to drop it in the post-office, where it may lie
until the next day; the other, to hire a conveyance, and send a
special messenger with it to the person addressed. The cost of
this special service will vary from one dollar to two dollars.
Our practice is to deliver by special messenger, and charge therefor
the actual cost of the service.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>EUROPEAN CHARGES FOR DELIVERING TELEGRAMS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A similar custom prevails in Europe, as will appear from the
following extracts from the rules and regulations applicable to
stations in the Austro-Germanic Telegraph Union, which comprises
Austria, Prussia, Hanover, Holland, Saxony, Wurtemburg,
the German Duchies, also France and the whole South of Europe:</p>

<h4 class='c042'><span class='sc'>Charges for Postage, Foot Messenger, and Estafette.</span></h4>

<p class='c011'>The instruction for forwarding despatches beyond Telegraph lines must
be inserted in messages immediately after receiver’s address and charged
for; messages with no instructions will be sent on from Terminal Telegraph
Station by post.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>TELEGRAMS TO BE PLACED IN THE STREET BOXES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hubbard’s proposition to put telegrams into street-boxes is
simply absurd. Telegrams are always of an important nature, and
need despatch. Imagine a message announcing sickness, death,
or any other circumstance, being dropped in the street box, to be
taken out when the carrier happens round! As for post-offices,
how many are there in any of the large cities even? Few have
more than one, and this is closed when a mail arrives,—a circumstance
that seems to have rendered the closed condition the
normal one with many post-offices.</p>

<p class='c009'>To give an idea of the extent of present facilities in the principal
cities, the following statement, showing the number of telegraph
offices now open, is submitted:—</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PRIVILEGED PERSONS TO HAVE PRIORITY IN THE USE OF THE WIRES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hubbard’s plan of allowing “messages requiring immediate
despatch to have priority of transmission on payment of extra
rates,” would abolish the rule which has always been observed
since the establishment of the telegraph in this country, “first
come first served,” and give privileged persons the priority in the
use of the wires. What an excellent opportunity this would afford
speculative combinations (like that which locked up twenty millions
of currency in Wall Street a short time ago) to extend their
operations all over the country, by practically controlling the telegraph?</p>

<p class='c009'>This plan would not answer at all. No system of variation of
rate is feasible, consistently with public policy, but that which offers
a lower rate for business which will consent to be delayed until
another day.</p>

<p class='c009'>In regard to the establishment of a money-order system by telegraph,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>we would say that we have long done something in the way
of transmitting deposits and money orders by telegraph. We have
made no effort to bring it prominently before the public, with a view
to extending this department of our business, for the reason that as
an established system it would be comparatively easy for rogues to
abuse it. It is only resorted to in cases of great emergency, where
money orders by post cannot be delivered in time to meet the
necessities of the case. It is also confined mainly to the transmission
of small sums. It involves necessarily the sending of two
messages. Large amounts required in commercial transactions are
daily transmitted or exchanged in this manner by the regular
banking houses in all the principal cities.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PROPOSITION TO OPERATE TELEGRAPHS AT A LOSS, AND MAKE MONEY BY IT.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hubbard proposes, by his new plan, to send telegrams at an
average reduction of 53 per cent from the present charges, which
we have shown to be 25 per cent less than the European rates.
Now, the total receipts of the Western Union Telegraph Company
for the year ending June 30, 1867, were $6,568,925, and a reduction
of 53 per cent would leave $3,087,405.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hubbard acknowledges that neither the government nor any
company can transmit messages at the above rates without loss,
but claims that “a company with well-constructed lines, <i>built for
cash</i>, can transmit messages at these rates, in connection with the
post-office, and realize a large profit.” Precisely how this is to be
done, or what the lines “built for cash” have got to do about it,
does not appear. Mr. Hubbard says in his pamphlet that “the
largest part of the lines of the Western Union Company were
constructed before the rise in prices, and on a gold basis.” Now,
if he means that lines built on a paper basis can be worked cheaper
than those constructed on a gold one, we would be glad to hear
his reasons for so singular a notion.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>SPECULATIVE TELEGRAPH SCHEMES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We consider it our duty to say a word concerning the swarm
of adventurers who are canvassing the country for subscriptions
to utterly worthless telegraph stock, and who are besieging the
halls of Congress every year for some recognition or advantage
which shall enable them the more readily to impose upon the
public.</p>

<p class='c009'>The National Telegraph Company is an example in point.
This concern, which claims to have organized two years ago
under an act of Congress, and which has filled the country with
runners begging for subscriptions to its stock, has never set a
pole.</p>

<p class='c009'>The losses which have occurred in the operation of competing
lines are enormous. The country is full of people who have lost
money in these schemes, which, after a brief existence, are wound
up and their effects disposed of by the sheriff.</p>

<p class='c009'>The present condition of all the opposition lines is very precarious.
The Franklin Company was made by a consolidation
of the Insulated Company, having four wires between Boston and
Washington, and the old Franklin Company, having two wires
between Boston and New York. The capital of the former was
$1,250,000, and of the latter $500,000. The new organization
has been in operation about two years, during which time its receipts
have fallen so far below its expenses that it has contracted
a debt of $125,000; and its lines have deteriorated to such an
extent that a large sum would have to be expended to put them
in proper condition for business. The stock of such companies is
valueless as an investment, and, in respect to some of them, it is
doubtful if their property could be sold for a sum sufficient to
pay their indebtedness.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Atlantic and Pacific Company has a line from New York
to Chicago, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</span></i> Albany, Buffalo, Cleveland, and Sandusky, averaging
about two wires for each line. Its lines are built under
a contract to take stock in payment, at the rate of $1,666.66 per
mile for a line of two wires.</p>

<p class='c009'>The operation of these separate and irresponsible lines, during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the brief period of their existence, retards the progress of legitimate
telegraphy, and impairs the general unity of the system.
Any legislation of Congress which is made to further such schemes
has the direct effect of aiding a class of speculators to fleece
a credulous public, by inducing them to invest their money
in the construction of lines which never have paid, and never can
pay, the expenses of operating them, and which are of no benefit
to any persons but those who originate them, and profit by their
construction.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>MORE STARTLING INVENTIONS FOR RAPID TELEGRAPHING.</h3>

<p class='c011'>We quote from Mr. Hubbard:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Instruments have been recently invented, and are in operation,
either in England or in this country, by which two great
hindrances to the efficiency of the telegraph are remedied. Mr.
Stearns, president of the Franklin Telegraph Company, has invented
an instrument by which messages are transmitted both
ways at the same time, on the same wire, thus doubling its
capacity without any increase of expense. Sir Charles Wheatstone,
in England, has invented an instrument by which double
the number of words can be transmitted and received on the same
wire, at an increased expense in the preparation of the message
for transmission. Instruments are also in operation in Great Britain,
worked by boys, after instruction of one or two days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In regard to Mr. Stearns’s apparatus for working both ways
over one wire at the same time, we are compelled to say there is
nothing new in the idea. Doctor Gintl, of Germany, invented it
many years ago, and it was published in an Italian work,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> with
steel-plate illustration, issued in 1861, translated into English by
George B. Prescott, of Albany, and published in the Telegraphic
Journal, London, May, 1864. Moses G. Farmer, Esq., of Boston,
invented another apparatus for doing the same thing, and
worked it between Boston and Portland, in 1849. If there is
any practical value in this apparatus it is open—like the Morse
Telegraph—to the use of all. Sir Charles Wheatstone’s apparatus,
by which double the number of words can be received on the
same wire, will probably prove of the same practical value as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>many similar inventions, which in theory can transmit intelligence
with the greatest accuracy at the astonishing rate of five
or ten thousand words an hour, but in practice have never proved
of the slightest value.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Manuale di Telegrafia Elettrica, di Carlo Matteucci, Torino, 1861.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is suggestive, that, of more than a hundred inventions designed
to supersede the Morse telegraph, the latter instrument is
used to-day on more than 490,000 miles of wire out of the total of
500,000 in operation in all parts of the world. Mr. Hubbard’s
assertion, “that instruments are in operation in Great Britain,
worked by boys, after instruction of one or two days,” may be true.
From all accounts, the use of boys—and charity boys at that—has
been the great curse of telegraphy in England, until the saying
has become common there, when describing a remarkably poor
specimen of chirography, that “it is written as badly as a telegraph
despatch.” We hope the day is far distant when our
messages shall be transmitted by boys with one or two days’ instruction.</p>

<p class='c009'>We hardly need say that it is for our interest to adopt every
improvement whereby the despatch of business within a given
time can be materially increased. It is certainly cheaper for us
to provide new instruments, at almost any cost which will ever be
charged therefor, than to put up, keep in repair, and operate
additional wires to produce the same results.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus we find that in reproducing from their various currencies
the gross telegraphic receipts of six nations into United States gold,
Mr. Hubbard makes the amount $1,435,120.14 less than it should
be, and in reducing those of three other countries into our coin he
makes the amount $93,417.36 more than it should be.</p>

<p class='c009'>He has also failed to give the receipts of the three great Submarine
Telegraph Companies, which transact so important an
amount of continental telegraph business.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hubbard gives the number of stations in Switzerland at
333, while the best English authority<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a> gives it at 252. He also
gives the number of messages transmitted in England, in 1866, as
6,127,000, while Mr. Scudamore, in his reply to the statement of
the Electric and International Telegraph Company, published in
May, 1868,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> points out the fact that only 5,781,189 messages were
transmitted throughout Great Britain and Ireland during that year.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>EUROPEAN TELEGRAMS COUNTED SEVERAL TIMES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>An examination of Mr. Hubbard’s statement of the number of
messages sent in Europe, in 1866, will reveal the fact that he has
included inland, international, and transit messages to make up the
grand total. In this way he has counted the same message several
times. For instance, messages sent from England to France, or
any two contiguous countries, would be counted in each. Messages
between France and Germany would be counted in France
and Germany as international messages, and in Belgium and perhaps
some other country as transit. The same would be the case
between all European countries whose territories do not border on
each other. A message going from France to Russia, or from
England to Turkey, might be counted a dozen times.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the United States each message is counted but once, although
it may traverse thousands of miles in reaching its place of
destination.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have not the statistics to show what proportion the legitimate
number of messages sent bears to this fictitious number; but
by referring to the Belgian table it will be seen that 692,536 inland
and 306,596 international messages were sent in 1866, in a
total of 1,128,005. Taking this as a fair average for the whole
of Europe, we shall find that only 14,012,795 messages were
sent in 1866, at an expense, in United States currency, of
$15,286,911.61, or about $1.09 each.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>LABOR THE PRINCIPAL ELEMENT OF EXPENSE IN OPERATING TELEGRAPHS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The principal element of expense in our business is the cost of
labor.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> If we can do our work as cheaply as another party, it is
clear that rates can never be reduced below the point at which receipts
and expenses are equal. Any material increase of business,
no matter what the rates may be, must be attended with increased
expense. And when the capacity of the wires provided for a particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>service is exhausted, a new question is presented by the
necessity for providing additional facilities. By the extension of
our lines this year west of Chicago, and by the moderate increase
in the volume of our business in that section of the country, it
will probably become necessary during next year to provide two
additional wires between Chicago and the Atlantic coast. The
cost of these wires, if erected on poles now standing, will be about
$120,000. We shall also be obliged to put up an additional wire
between Washington and New Orleans, and between the latter
place and Louisville. The cost of maintaining the lines will be
somewhat increased by the addition of these wires, and the cost
of operating at each end, and looking after them at intermediate
points, must also be included. How is the additional capital necessary
to provide such increased facilities to be raised? By reducing
rates, the result of which is, that, even if gross receipts are not
diminished, the expenses are increased? Is it not by gradually increasing
lines out of current profits, and as gradually reducing rates
after facilities for an enlarged business have been provided?</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. The Western Union Telegraph Company expended $2,573,434.80 for labor for
the year ending June 30, 1867. See comparison of cost of labor in Europe and the
United States on page <a href='#Page_26'>26</a>.</p>

<div class='section'>

<h3 class='c010'>PREVAILING ERROR OF ALL THEORIZERS ON THE BUSINESS OF TELEGRAPHING.</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>All theorizers upon the subject of the telegraph fall into the
error that the amount of business which may be done at any point
(the rates being low enough) is in the ratio of population. An
investigation of the subject will show this to be entirely erroneous.
Three years ago, when the subject of telegraphic communication
between the Eastern and Western continents was discussed by
those most intimately connected with the enterprise, no one estimated
the number of messages which would pass between the two
continents, daily, at a rate of $50 gold for ten words, below 500.
But few placed the figures so low. Most of them estimated the
number at two or three times this minimum.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1863 Mr. Cyrus W. Field made the following remarks before
the Chamber of Commerce of New York, in relation to the
probable amount of business that would be done between Europe and
America when communication by telegraph should be established:
“To express my own opinion, from pretty large experience on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>subject, I do not believe that <i>ten</i> cables would begin to do the
work which would, in a short time, be given to it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the banquet given in London, in 1864, to inaugurate the
renewed attempt by the Atlantic Telegraph Company to unite
Europe and America by means of the Atlantic cable, Mr.
Cromwell F. Varley made the following remarks touching the
amount of business that would be offered for transmission over
the cable: “I feel great confidence that, when once a cable is
successfully laid across the Atlantic, the demands upon it will be
so great that you will have to lay one or two per annum for the
next twenty years, or even more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Their disappointment was, therefore, very great when, after the
Atlantic Cable was in operation, it was found that the daily average
at the $100 tariff was but 29 messages, and at the $50 tariff, which
was in operation thirteen months, it was but 64. At the $25 rate
the average advanced to 131; and although the rate has been still
further reduced to $16.85, the average is but 201. This illustration
is sufficient to prove the fallacy of all reasoning concerning
telegraph business based merely upon population. We
venture the prediction that, at the rate of $5 between Europe
and America, the number of messages which would pass per day
would never equal the number exchanged daily between New
York on one hand, and Philadelphia and Boston on the other.
The reason is simply this: The number of messages which will
pass within a given time between two points depends, first, upon a
reasonable charge for transmission,—a charge conveniently within
the means of those having occasion to communicate; and secondly
and mainly, upon the number of people at either extreme having
intimate business relations with those at the other. The vast commerce
of the Old World and the New is not exchanged in detail,
but in bulk. A few banking houses on each side make all the exchanges
for both continents, and the agricultural products and the
manufactures of both are also exchanged in substantially the same
manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have shown how fallacious is the claim that the increase of
business is dependent upon the tariff, by the statistics of our own
and foreign countries, by which it appears that business has sometimes
largely increased at an advanced rate. We do not desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>to be understood, however, as saying that low tariffs, under similar
circumstances, will not bring more business than high ones. But
we do say that it is susceptible of proof, that the minimum rate is
undoubtedly much higher than most of those who theorize upon
this subject are willing to believe. Take the case of the Atlantic
Cable as an illustration. During the three months at which the
tariff was $100, and the daily average of messages 29, the receipts
per day were £505. During the thirteen months, at the average
of 64 messages daily, the receipts were £579. During the nine
months, at the average of 131 messages per day, the receipts were
£635. And for the two months since the rates were reduced to
$16, the daily average has been 201 messages, and the average
receipts £596.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now it happens, fortunately for the Cable Company, that the
present volume of business is considerably less than the capacity of
their cables; so that the increase of that business has been attended
with but a very slight additional expense, the cost to operate being
the same at offices open day and night, whether operators are
occupied all or only a part of the time. But suppose, for illustration,
that the limit of the capacities of the cables will be reached when
the average number of messages per day is 250. To undertake to
transmit any number beyond this without further facilities would
result in crowding and confusing the business to an extent which
would inevitably produce dissatisfaction. On the other hand, to
provide an additional cable would cost a sum of money which it
might be exceedingly difficult to raise. It seems proper, therefore,
that the profits from this business should always be considerably more
than enough to yield a proper return for the capital invested, so that
greater facilities may be provided out of surplus profits; and, as
facilities are increased, rates may be gradually reduced, until, by
judiciously pursuing this course, the charges for telegraphing may
be materially diminished, without endangering the revenues to
which owners of telegraph property are justly entitled.</p>

<h3 class='c042'>THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The United States not only has the distinguished honor of being
the birthplace of the inventor of the universally-used electric telegraph,
but of having constructed the first line of practical telegraph,
and of being the foremost nation in the world, at the present
time, in the number of her telegraph stations, extent of her
lines and wires, cheapness of her rates, and amount of business
done.</p>

<p class='c009'>The United States contains 4,126 telegraph offices; 62,782
miles of line; 125,564 miles of wire; and transmits annually
12,904,777 telegrams.</p>

<p class='c009'>She has nearly as many telegraph stations as, and sends a greater
number of telegrams annually than, all Continental Europe, and
contains as many miles of line as Belgium, Bavaria, France, Great
Britain and Ireland, Italy, Russia, Switzerland, and Spain combined.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PROPORTION OF TELEGRAMS TO LETTERS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The proportion of telegrams to letters in the United States is
difficult of determination, from the fact that our Post-Office Department
furnishes no statistics of the number of letters sent through the
mails, and has no means of ascertaining the number approximately,
except by the number of stamps sold annually. This mode of
estimation is very defective, because the stamps sold may not have
been used, or if used, may have covered the postage on books, parcels,
and other matter. The Postmaster-General states, in his report
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>for 1867, that there were 283,762,300 three-cent stamps sold
during the preceding year. Supposing each of these stamps to
represent a letter, we have the following comparative result of the
number of telegrams to letters in the various countries where the
telegraph is most extensively used:—</p>

<h3 class='c010'>EARLY HISTORY OF THE TELEGRAPH IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>During the first few years after the introduction of the electric
telegraph its progress was very slow. Capitalists were afraid to
invest in an undertaking so novel and precarious, and as a natural
consequence there was great difficulty in raising funds for properly
building the lines, and they were constructed in a very unreliable
manner, breaks and interruptions being rather the normal condition
of the wires than the exception.</p>

<p class='c009'>At a very early period in the history of the electric telegraph in
the United States, a misunderstanding occurred between the Morse
patentees and a contractor under them, the result of which was
that rival lines were constructed throughout the country before the
system had been sufficiently developed to be remunerative, even
without such competition.</p>

<p class='c009'>The invention of the letter-printing telegraph by Mr. House, in
1846, and the introduction of the electro-chemical telegraph of Mr.
Bain into this country, in 1849, greatly facilitated the construction
of competing lines.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first line operating under the House patent was completed
in March, 1849, from Philadelphia to New York City. The Boston
and New York Telegraph Company, using the same patent,
was completed in the autumn of the same year, and was followed
by one from New York to Buffalo, and subsequently to St. Louis
and Chicago.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the year 1849, which was very prolific in the production
of competing lines, the Bain patent was introduced upon lines extending
between New York and Buffalo, and New York and Washington,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and, in the succeeding year, upon lines extending between
Boston and Montreal, and Boston and Portland.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1851 there were seven Bain lines in operation in the United
States, having over 2,000 miles of wire; eight House lines, having
about 300 miles of wire; and sixty-seven Morse lines, having
20,000 miles of wire. In the autumn of this year, the Morse and
Bain lines between New York and Washington were consolidated;
and in the succeeding spring the Morse and Bain lines between
New York and Boston were united under one company. The
union of these lines was followed by that of the New York and
Buffalo Morse and Bain lines, and subsequently by those of the
House lines between these points.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>EVILS ARISING FROM SEPARATE ORGANIZATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The consolidation of these lines was a step in the right direction,
as it increased the receipts and lessened the expenses of the
companies, while it enabled them to do the business better, by
possessing greater facilities. Still, the great number of separate
organizations remaining throughout the country prevented that
unity and despatch in the conduct of the business so essential to its
success. Under these circumstances, the public failed to realize the
brilliant thought of instant communication between distant points.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Boston house, doing business with Chicago, was obliged to
be content with responses received on the second or third day.
On Boston despatches for Chicago four tariffs were charged; and
a message had to be copied off and handed over to other companies
for transmission at New York, Buffalo, and Detroit, before it
reached its destination.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this process required time, and yet the loss of time was the
least of the evils connected with such a state of things. The
message, as it left the writer’s hands in Boston, was not unfrequently
a very different document when it reached the Western
parties, owing to errors caused by its numerous retransmissions,
and thus the necessity became urgent to unite these separate companies
into one living, vigorous organization, by which not only
repetition and error might be avoided, but the messages followed
to their destination under a single direction, and undivided responsibility.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>THE UNIFICATION OF THE TELEGRAPH ACCOMPLISHED.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It was at this period, when segregated lines were feeling their
weakness, and their revenues were unequal to even a current
vigorous support, that a few clear-sighted men in the West conceived
the project of buying up the groups of feeble organizations,
and making them direct leaders between the large Western cities.
The stock was comparatively valueless, and easily and cheaply
bought. The needs of commercial intercourse were pressing.
The project had in it the true elements of success, and it was
accomplished.</p>

<p class='c009'>For seven years thereafter the purchasers went on improving
the lines thus acquired, and rendering their connections more certain.
During all these years no dividends were paid. Time and
money and all the earnings of the line were devoted to that
series of combinations which, from a mass of weak and perishing
organizations, culminated in the Western Union Telegraph Company.</p>

<p class='c009'>This combination of lines saved the system from disgrace, and
made it available to commerce and to public wants. No increase
of rates followed any of these movements; and none would ever
have been made, had not war come to change values, and rendered
it necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the East, the American Telegraph Company, organized in
1855, followed a similar course, and ultimately controlled lines
extending throughout the Atlantic seaboard and Mississippi
Valley. These two companies, working in connection and harmony,
covered the entire area of the United States, and performed
the business of telegraphing better than it had ever been
done before.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1863 the United States Telegraph Company was organized,
and constructed lines in the territories occupied by both the
Western Union and American companies; but in 1865, with
16,000 miles of wire,—all newly built,—worked to their full
capacity during the year they were unable to meet their current
expenses; but under the most vigorous administration, with its
expenses reduced within the closest limits, found that it was conducting
its business at an average net loss of nearly $10,000 per month.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>In the spring of 1866 the Western Union, American, and
United States Telegraph Companies were consolidated, thus producing
a complete unification of the great telegraphic system of the
United States, and rendering it the most complete and extensive
in the world. This consolidation, however, gave the Western
Union Telegraph Company no monopoly of the business. The
Morse patent having expired, and no exclusive privileges being
granted by either State or national governments, the construction
and operation of telegraph lines within the jurisdiction of the United
States remained freely open to all.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>TELEGRAPH COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The following list of some of the more important telegraph companies
now doing business in the United States will convey an idea
of the importance of this interest: Bankers and Brokers’ Telegraph
Company, capital $1,050,000, lines extending from New York to
Washington; Pacific and Atlantic Telegraph Company, capital
$3,000,000, lines completed from Philadelphia to Pittsburg and
Cincinnati, and extending; Franklin Telegraph Company, capital
$1,000,000, lines extending from Boston to Washington; International
Telegraph Company, capital $300,000, lines completed
from Boston to Bangor, Me., and will be extended farther east;
Keystone Telegraph Company, lines extending from Philadelphia
to Harrisburg and Pittsburg; International Ocean Telegraph Company,
lines extending from Lake City to Key West and Havana;
Northern Telegraph Company, capital $100,000, lines completed
from Boston to Bristol, N. H., and extending; Atlantic and Pacific
Telegraph Company, capital $5,000,000, lines completed from
New York to Chicago and extending; Great Western Telegraph
Company, line completed between Chicago and Milwaukee;
Northwestern Telegraph Company, capital $1,150,000, lines extending
from Milwaukee through Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa,
and Minnesota; Mississippi Valley Telegraph Company, lines
extending between St. Paul, Minn., and St. Louis, and from
Dubuque to Chicago; Western Union Telegraph Company, capital
$40,347,700, lines extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the
Gulf of the St. Lawrence, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific
ocean. There are in addition to this list quite a large number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>companies, covering more or less territory, which, with all of
the above mentioned, are independent organizations, and nearly
all of them engaged in competition with each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>Private enterprise has with us, so far, achieved much greater
results than governmental management in Europe. As regards
the tariff for messages, they are less than the rates established
in Europe. Considerable reductions have been made within the
past year, amounting, in some cases, to as much as 50 per cent.
The reductions have taken place to the greatest extent in those
sections of the country where there are opposition lines, the rates
over some of these routes being less than the expense of doing
the business, but the reductions are not confined to these sections.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Western Union Telegraph Company has reduced its rates
between upwards of one thousand offices where there is no opposition;
and it is now preparing a new tariff of rates, based upon airline
distances, between all stations, irrespective of the circuitous
routes that the lines take to reach them, which will still farther
simplify and cheapen the system.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is the purpose of this company to do the telegraphing of the
United States as well, and at as low rates, as it can be done by any
organization which can be formed, and thus maintain its possession
of the first and most extensive system of telegraphy in the
world.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>DOMINION OF CANADA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the Dominion of Canada as in the United States, the telegraph

<p class='c009'>Austria transmitted 44,911 messages in 1851, and 381,720 in
1857, being an increase of over 800 per cent without any average
reduction in rates. The increase in the number of messages from
1857 to 1866 was less than 700 per cent, notwithstanding the
great reduction in the rates from 2.32 to 0.65 florins.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>BELGIUM.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The statistics respecting the working of the telegraph in Belgium
are used by Mr. Washburne primarily to prove the superior
advantages and excellence of the Belgian telegraphic system and
arrangement, but chiefly to show that a cheapened rate has increased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>its use, and that to secure that result in this country the
telegraph must be placed under governmental control.</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely any two nations could be named whose conditions are
more unlike.</p>

<p class='c009'>The area of Belgium is about one fourth that of the State of
New York, with nearly the same population. Its greatest length
is 175 miles, its width 105.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three chief cities of Belgium are not more than thirty
miles apart, while those of secondary rank are equally contiguous.
All the railroads in the kingdom belong to the government, and a
large proportion of the telegraph offices are at the railway stations,
the post-offices being merely offices of deposit, from which messages
are despatched free of charge to the nearest telegraph office,
if in the same district; otherwise by special messenger, on the payment
of an extra fee.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the government of the United States owns no railroads, they
could not use the stations for offices, except by special arrangements,
which can as readily be effected by private companies.</p>

<p class='c009'>The telegrams of Belgium are of three distinct sorts,—internal,
international, and transit. The system differs essentially from that
of the United States, inasmuch as the principal business of the
Belgian telegraph is to transmit messages from one country to
another, whilst the principal business of the American telegraph
is the conveyance of internal messages. The only international
messages transmitted on the lines in the United States are those
sent to Europe by the Atlantic cable, to Cuba by the Cuban
cable, and to the various stations in the Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the arguments used in favor of the assumption of telegraphs
by government is, that in its hands the telegraph is more
largely accessible to the people, and more freely used. The facts
are as follows, giving Belgium the benefit of the increase of messages
shown by the last reduction of her tariff.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>BELGIUM.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Population, 5,000,000; messages, 692,536. Ratio, one message
to each seventh person.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>GREAT BRITAIN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Population, 29,500,000; messages, 5,781,189. Ratio, one message
to each fifth person.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>UNITED STATES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Population, 31,148,047; messages, 12,904,770. Ratio, one message
to every two and one half persons.</p>

<p class='c009'>These facts prove a clear advantage in favor of private control.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>BAVARIA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>This country possesses 2,115 miles of lines, and 4,945 miles of
wire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gross receipts for 1866, 322,886 florins. Expenditures, 258,625
florins.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>DENMARK.</h3>

<p class='c011'>This country now contains 2,515 miles of wire, and eighty-nine
telegraphic stations open to the public. The Morse apparatus is
the only one employed. Of these eighty-nine stations, fifty-three
belong to the government, twenty-one to private telegraph companies,
and fifteen to railroads.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tariff is fixed at ninety cents for a local telegram of
twenty words between any points in the kingdom. In 1867 there
were transmitted 308,150 telegrams, of which 174,560 were local
and 133,590 foreign. All the stations send written despatches in
all languages, even in cipher, the only conditions being legible
writing in an alphabet transmissible by the Morse apparatus.</p>

<p class='c009'>Money orders to the amount of 50 rix-dollars can be paid at
all post-offices by means of the telegraph. The sum being deposited
at the original office, an official telegram is sent to the
place designated, ordering payment.</p>

<p class='c009'>For this service the sender has only to pay the tariff on the official
telegram. Messages can be sent from points where there are
no telegraphic stations, by sending them by post or by any other
mode of transportation to the nearest telegraph station. These
telegrams can be paid by a postage-stamp affixed to a designated
part of the form. These forms are the same as the printed envelopes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>and can be procured at all post and telegraph offices. At
the top of these forms is printed an extract from the rules for the
transmission of despatches. The stamps are detached from the
forms and sent to the Department of Finances at the same time
that the other reports are forwarded. It is proposed to extend
these privileges to the private and railroad telegraph stations.</p>

<p class='c009'>From 1863 to 1867 the telegraphic intercourse between the
Scandinavian countries has increased each year twenty-five per
cent.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class='c011'>England was among the first countries in Europe to adopt the
electric telegraph; and, next to the United States, is the foremost
nation in the world in the extent of her lines, the number of her
offices, the cheapness of her rates, and the number of messages
annually transmitted. With a population about three quarters as
large as that of France, she possesses nearly twice as many telegraph
stations, and annually transmits more than twice as many messages.</p>

<p class='c009'>There are in operation in Europe fifty-five submarine cables,
varying in length from three to 1,500 miles, and containing a total
length of over 11,000 miles of insulated wire, nearly all of which
were laid and are owned by English capitalists. The success of
the Atlantic cables, also laid by English companies, is another
illustration of what can be accomplished by private enterprise untrammelled
by governmental interference; and affords a striking
contrast to the fate of the Red Sea cable laid by the British government,
and which has proved one of the greatest failures
recorded in the annals of submarine telegraphy. This cable,
which was to connect Suez and Kurrachee, 3,500 miles in length,
was laid in five sections, but never worked a day through its
entire length.</p>

<p class='c009'>For some unexplained reason the British post-office department
has been determined to absorb the telegraph system of the United
Kingdom, and through the indefatigable efforts of Mr. Scudamore,
one of the secretaries of the department, the British government
was finally induced to purchase the property of all the telegraph
companies in the kingdom, and thus monopolize the business. The
price to be paid for the lines is twenty times the net earnings of
the companies for the past year.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>That the English government has made a serious mistake in
assuming the control of the telegraph we have no question; but
its operation will be better in its hands than it would be in that of
our government, for the reason that its employees are not removed
with every change of administration, as government officials are in
the United States.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>DECREES REGULATING THE USE OF THE TELEGRAPH IN FRANCE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The following is a digest of the decrees issued by the French
government regulating the use of the telegraph in the empire.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>1st.</i> All persons whose identity is established are allowed to
correspond by the government electric telegraph.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>2d.</i> Private correspondence is always subordinate to the necessity
of government service.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>3d.</i> Despatches are to be written in <i>ordinary and intelligible
language</i>, dated and signed by the sender, and to be given to the
officer of the telegraph station, whose duty it is to <i>copy in full the
despatch</i>, with the address of the sender.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>4th.</i> The director of a station may, on grounds of public order
and morality, <i>refuse to transmit a despatch</i>. In case of dispute,
reference is to be made, in Paris, to the minister of the interior; in
the provinces to the prefect, sub-prefect, or other constituted
authority. On the receipt of a despatch, the director of the station
may <i>withhold its delivery</i> for like reasons.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>5th.</i> Private correspondence may be suspended at any time by
the government. <i>The government will not assume any responsibility
for errors in the transmission of despatches.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><i>6th.</i> The director of the station must be satisfied as to the
identity of the sender’s signature. If the director refuses the
transmission of a message, he must state his reason in writing on
the despatch. He must indorse on it “political,” “offensive,”
“not consistent with public good,” etc.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>7th.</i> No line of electric telegraph can be established or employed
for the transmission of correspondence except by the government,
or on its authority. <i>Any person transmitting, without
authority, signals from one place to another, whether by electric telegraph,
or in any other way, is liable to imprisonment from one
month to a year, and a fine of 1,000 to 10,000 francs, and the
government may order the destruction of the apparatus and telegraph
employed.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><i>8th.</i> Any one <i>accidentally</i> interrupting the correspondence of
the electric telegraph, or injuring in any way the lines or apparatus,
is liable to a fine of from 16 to 3,000 francs.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span><i>9th.</i> Any one wilfully causing an interruption, by injuring the
lines or apparatus, is punishable by imprisonment from three
months to two years, and a fine of 100 to 1,000 francs. Any
one who shall menace an operator during periods of insurrectionary
movements is subject to a fine of 1,000 to 5,000 francs.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>10th.</i> Written statements by telegraph officers to be received
as evidence in all complaints.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>11th.</i> Reimbursements of charges on despatches, in consequence
of delays or errors in transmission, cannot be made except by the
administration. When a despatch is withdrawn by the forwarder
before transmission, the expense of delivery only can be refunded.</p>

<p class='c009'>The charge on despatches sent in the night will be double the
usual tariff for the day business (the exact opposite of the American
rule).</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PECULIAR CHARACTER OF THE FRENCH TELEGRAPH.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The telegraph lines in France are nearly all owned and managed
by the government. The English Submarine Company, however,
is a private enterprise, and works from Paris through Calais to
the United Kingdom. There is also another company organized
under permission of the imperial government, for the extension of
the lines into the French colonies of Africa. This association is
called the Mediterranean Electric Telegraph Company, and it has
constructed its line from Spezzia, in Sardinia, across Corsica, Sardinia,
and the Mediterranean, to Bóne, in Africa.</p>

<p class='c009'>The telegraph in France is regarded as one of the most important
arms of the government, and the wires are known as the
<i>fingers of the police</i>. The Emperor would no sooner relinquish
their control than he would that of his armies. By imperial
decree, every operator is created a spy in the service of the government.
The wires from every part of France centre in the
imperial chamber, and not a message passes throughout the empire
which is not examined by government inspectors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the promptness, regularity, or correctness with which French
telegraphs are conducted no proof is given by which superior
excellence is established. There is nothing in the whole exhibit,
or in the actual working of the French telegraphs, which presents
any reason for the assumption that governments manage telegraphs
better than the people.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>INCREASE IN TELEGRAMS NOT DUE TO LOW RATES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It will be observed, by an examination of the above table, that
low tariffs are not the only causes of the enlarged use of the telegraph.
The annual percentage of increase in messages, as tariffs
were gradually reduced, was vastly less than during those years
when the rates remained unchanged. During the year of 1851
only 9,014 telegrams were transmitted through the French empire,
the tariff averaging $1.60 per message. Five years later,
notwithstanding that the average cost per message had been
<i>increased</i> to $1.73, the number of messages had increased to
360,299, and in 1858 to 463,973,—more than fifty times the number
sent in 1851, or <i>an increase of more than five thousand per cent
in eight years, without any reduction in rates</i>. The increase in the
number of messages during the next eight years, from 1858 to
1866, was only six hundred per cent, notwithstanding a reduction
in the tariff from 7.60 to 2.79 francs.</p>

<p class='c009'>This same peculiarity of increase, without regard to the cost, is
also observable in all other countries, as will be seen by a perusal
of the official tables.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>GREECE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The Kingdom of Greece has twelve telegraph stations. All the
messages between the Greek and European lines pass through
Turkey, and consequently the rate is very high. It is proposed
to establish a direct line between Greece and Southern Italy by
continuing the Corfu cable to Pauras or Missolonghi, across the
Ionian Islands.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>PRUSSIA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In Prussia the number of messages transmitted in 1866, the last
year of which we have data, was 1,964,030, and the gross receipts
were 1,275,785 thalers, making the average cost per message
seventy cents in our currency. Prussia had in that year a population
of 17,740,000, and the area of her territory was somewhat
less than the New England States and New York. Distance
being regarded, the Prussian rates were at that period double our
own.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be observed that the number of messages transmitted in
1852 was 48,751, and in 1860, 384,335, being an increase in nine
years of nearly 800 per cent, although there was no reduction in
the average tariff during this period. From 1860 to 1866 there
was an increase of only 500 per cent, notwithstanding a reduction
in the rates from 2.06 to 0.656 thalers per message.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prussia was among the earliest of Continental countries to adopt
the electric telegraph, and it is still far in advance of most of its
neighbors in the practical development of the enterprise; and
yet, with a population more than half as great as the United
States, she only transmits one sixth as many messages per annum.
Were the system left to private enterprise, as in this country, there
can be no doubt that this enlightened and thrifty people would
greatly extend the system, and in place of the meagre supply of
538 offices she would have upwards of 2,000, and in place of
1,964,030 messages per annum would transmit seven or eight
millions.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>RUSSIA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>European Russia, with a population considerably more than twice
as great as the United States, contains but 308 offices, or one to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>230,000 of people; and sends annually but 838,653 messages, or
one to each 80,723 of her population.</p>

<p class='c009'>Any person examining the telegraphic map of Russia will be satisfied
that the rose-colored descriptions of government telegraphs as
illustrated in Russia are overdrawn. The lines radiating from St.
Petersburg, and extending to Warsaw, Moscow, Odessa, Sebastopol,
Nichni-Novgorod, to the Persian frontier, and to Kiakhta in
Siberia,—all important military points,—and with scarcely any
connecting interior lines, suggest anything but a desire to afford
ample telegraphic facilities to the people.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>SWITZERLAND.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The situation of Switzerland, in the centre of Europe, and forming
the pathway between nations, places her in a peculiar position
with reference to the transmission of messages from one country
to another. Just as Belgium is situated in relation to intercourse
between France and Germany, so Switzerland is placed in regard
to telegraphic communication between France and Italy, and Italy
and Germany. Switzerland, from many circumstances, is a country
in which telegraphic communication is eminently useful. In
the first place it is a mountainous country, over which postal communication
is necessarily slow, and conducted at all seasons under
disadvantages. Besides all this, Switzerland, at certain seasons
of the year, is a country full of travellers and tourists from all
parts of the world, who find great advantage and convenience
in being able to transmit short messages from one place to another,
respecting hotel accommodations, baggage arrangements, lost packages,
horses, places in the diligence, and general matters relating
to their route, as well as business and social messages to their
relatives, friends, and agents at home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Switzerland is in the same position with Belgium in respect
to the means of cheap telegraphic communication. The railways
of the country all belong to the state; so that every railway is
available, without charge, for the passage of wires along the line,
and every railway official may be employed for telegraphic service,
at the pleasure of the government, for nothing. It is
scarcely necessary to point out how different must be the working
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of such a system from that of the United States, where the
railways are in the hands of private companies, and with whom
terms have to be made for the right of way.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>NO ANALOGY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND SWITZERLAND.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The analogy between the United States and Switzerland seems
in every sense imperfect. The telegraph stations in Switzerland
only number 252, or less than the number contained within a
radius of fifty miles in and around the city of New York.</p>

<p class='c009'>The total number of despatches transmitted annually in and
through Switzerland only amounted in 1866 to 668,916, whilst of
these probably more than half were either transit or international.
These transit telegrams, of which there are none in our country,
involve a most important difference. Belgium and Switzerland
can make up the deficiencies which arise from losses on internal
communication by the surplus derived from transit telegrams.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1852 the average number of messages per day, for all Switzerland,
was less than ten. As the system became extended, and the
people were educated to its use, the number of messages increased,
until in 1866 they exceeded 2,000 per day, approximating, for the
entire country, the number sent and received daily by fifteen
female operators in one of the rooms of the Western Union Telegraph
Company, in the city of New York. Probably one half
of these were transit messages passing through Switzerland from
stations in France, Belgium, and Italy, leaving about 1,000 messages
per day of inland business, which, divided among 252 offices, would
leave an average of a little less than <i>four messages per day for
each office</i>! This is not a very magnificent result, and is not over
encouraging as a model system, which gives to its twenty-five cantons
ten offices, with an average revenue from each; for inland
business, of only three francs per day! And this, notwithstanding
that the government coaches convey, without any extra
charge, messages, from towns unsupplied with offices, to the nearest
telegraph station.</p>

transmitted in Switzerland was from 2,876 in 1852 to 668,916 in

<h3 class='c010'>SPAIN.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Spain, with a population of over 16,000,000 souls, and possessing
the advantages of forming the pathway between France and her
African possessions, as well as between Portugal and the rest of
Europe, transmits a less number of telegrams per annum than the
Dominion of Canada, with her 3,000,000 inhabitants. That this
insignificant amount of business for so great a country is owing to
government control is evident from the following royal decree,
issued in conformity with the request of the Minister of State, who
says: “The petitions presented to your Majesty from different towns,
companies, and private individuals are so numerous and repeated,
praying that the advantages of telegraphic communications should
be granted to them, that the minister who now humbly addresses
your Majesty has lamented more than once that the care of the
government has not extended that satisfaction to legitimate wishes
so deserving of attention.”</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>ROYAL DECREE RELATING TO TELEGRAPHS IN SPAIN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In conformity with what the Minister of State for Home Affairs
has proposed to me, for the concession of telegraph lines and
stations.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>I have decreed as follows:</i>—</p>

<p class='c009'>The districts, towns, and public establishments, who wish to form
new lines or stations, <i>can solicit them from the government</i>, which
will inquire into the influence of the establishment of the said lines
or stations upon the state telegraphic system.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>The necessary cost of the lines and service must be paid by the
petitioners, and they must also give sufficient guaranty for the cost
of repairs and service.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>The petitioners will be obliged to pay to the state the difference
that may result between the annual income and the cost of the
service.</p>

<p class='c009'>If at the expiration of five years the expenses exceed the returns,
the line or station will be considered as property of the
state. No line or station can be formed without the consent of
the ministers in council.</p>

<p class='c009'>Service in all kinds of stations and lines can only be performed
by a staff from the government telegraph corps.</p>

<p class='c009'>All despatches passing through Spain (including the Balearic
Islands) and France (including Corsica) will pay the rate of five
francs per message of 20 words, no matter from what telegraph
office they proceed or to what station they are addressed. Each
ten words or part of ten words, beyond 20, will pay half the
amount of a single message.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cost of a single message transmitted from France to Algeria,
or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span></i>, passing through the Spanish or submarine lines, as
also of the messages between Spain and Algeria, transmitted either
by land or French cables, will always be eight francs. The messages
received or forwarded to Tunis will pay two francs more.</p>

<p class='c009'>The messages exceeding 20 words will pay an extra charge, in
accordance with the rule already established.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>No despatch whatever will be delivered out of the radius of the
locality wherein the station addressed to is situated, through any
other means than by post.</i></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Telegrams addressed to localities where there is no station will
be delivered by the last telegraphic office to the post, which will
undertake to convey them to their destination as certified parcels.</p>

<p class='c009'>When one despatch is addressed to several persons in the same
locality, as many telegrams will be charged for as there are individuals
to receive it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The acknowledgment of the receipt of a telegram will be
charged for as a new despatch.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Prepayment of despatches can be made, but if no answer is returned,
or if it should contain less words than those paid for, no
return of any kind will be made.</i> If the answer contains more
words than paid for, the station which sends it will charge the
difference between the amount paid and the corresponding one
to this new despatch.</p>

<p class='c009'>The claims for delay or irregularity of telegrams will only give
occasion for future inquiry into the causes which have produced
the irregularity in the service, for the knowledge of the interested
party, and to punish the functionary who should prove to be
culpable.</p>

<p class='c018'>Given at Aranjuez, on the 22d May, 1864.</p>

<p class='c009'>If there is any special benefit accruing to the people of Spain
by having the telegraph under government control, we fail to discover
it.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>TURKEY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Turkey contains twenty-eight telegraph stations, of which
twelve are open for night service, nine during the whole of
the day, and seven for a part only. Constantinople has two
stations open for international correspondence,—one at Stamboul,
the other at Pera; the first is principally confined to the transmission
of messages for the Ottoman government, and the second for
that of ambassadors and private persons. In the case of an interruption
of the cable which crosses the Hellespont, the Dardanelles
station is removed to Kaled-Bahas, and the despatches are subjected
to an additional rate of 90 cents for their conveyance, by
boat, from Kaled-Bahas to the Dardanelles. The tariff, upon
messages between Paris to any Turkish station, varies from
$2.80 to $6.00, according to the distance.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The construction of lines in Turkey is of the most defective
description, and the materials used very inferior. The lines pass
over the steepest and most inaccessible hills; and this state of
things is made worse by a very inadequate inspection, by men who
are both too few in number, wretchedly paid, and generally incompetent.
Repairers are compelled to provide and keep a
horse out of their pay of 300 piastres ($13.04) per month.
The chiefs of stations, and all other employees, are Turks, whose
lazy habits and incompetency cannot be wondered at, when the
smallness of their pay is considered. Added to these difficulties,
the service has to endure very frequent and arbitrary occupation
of the wires by the government, interrupting, on many occasions,
business of the most pressing nature, for the transmission of some
trivial communication, which would lose nothing by a short delay.
It may be imagined that as the service is in the hands of government,
much depends upon the director-general of the department.
Unfortunately, this official is in the unenviable position of
holding office on such a poor tenure that it may be said he
has a daily apprehension of being turned out, and replaced by one
of those numerous intriguers who swarm about the cabinets of
the ministers, or work through the more effectual influence of the
harem,—the great bane of the country. It has been proposed to
the Turkish government to employ a large staff of English inspectors
and operators, but the natural jealousy of employing foreigners
stands in the way. The Turks insist upon having all
messages sent through in Turkish, so that frequently, when retranslated,
they bear very slight resemblance to the original.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the important telegraphic intercourse between Europe and
India passes through the Turkish dominions. The effect of the
control of the Turkish government over the telegraph is most
disastrous, and renders this important connection with India almost
worthless.</p>

<p class='c009'>Repeated efforts have been made by the English telegraph
companies, who have so great an interest in the successful operation
of these lines, to induce the Turkish government to relinquish
its management of them, but thus far without success.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>REASONS<br /> <span class='small'>WHY</span><br /> <span class='large'>GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE OPERATION OF THE TELEGRAPH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The foregoing presentation of facts has shown that there are no
sufficient grounds for destroying the value of the investments of
the people in existing telegraph companies by governmental competition,
the telegraph system of this country being unrivalled
in its extent, unequalled in its administration, and unparalleled for
the low rates which it has always maintained.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this country the people have not been accustomed to rely
upon the government to provide those things for them which they
are able to secure by their own exertions. If this principle is
right in regard to one enterprise, it is also in relation to all others;
and if infringed upon in the case of the telegraph companies,
what pursuit will be safe from governmental interference?</p>

<p class='c009'>It is undoubtedly true that, were tariffs designed simply to
provide a revenue to support the lines, they are capable of reduction,
provided present arrangements with railroad companies and
others could be maintained, by which the labor of the one is utilized
in the service of the other. But for this the country makes
no demand. It recognizes the telegraph as a legitimate enterprise
for the investment of the capital and labor of its citizens. If false
counsels guide its development, public reprobation is ready with its
remedy. Its absorption by government would not only be a public
calamity, but a breach of the theory and spirit of our institutions,
and would soon result in its necessary return to individual control.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>POLITICAL REASONS WHY GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT CONTROL THE TELEGRAPH.</h3>

<p class='c011'>One of the most serious objections to the government of the
United States assuming the control of the telegraph is the political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>one. In monarchical countries, where the sovereignty is a patrimony
of a particular family, and where no change is made except
by revolution, everything which tends towards the permanence of
the reigning dynasty is looked upon as in the interest of law and
order, and for these reasons the absorption of the telegraphs by
the government is regarded as a proper and legitimate act, and
consistent with the public weal; but in a republic, where the
rulers are changed periodically, and where the purity of the elections
is of the first importance, the placing of so great a power
in the hands of the government would be a public calamity. It
might be supposed that rulers could be elected who would not take
advantage of the control of the telegraph for selfish purposes, but
the temptation to do so would be great, and, even if not yielded
to, the suspicions of the people would be constantly aroused, and
confidence in its impartial administration would be destroyed. In
every election the whole army of postmasters and the machinery
of the department is enlisted in the service of the party in power.
Shall we give it the telegraph also? What would be the influence
on election returns?</p>

<p class='c009'>The censorship of telegraphic correspondence, always a subject
of public disapprobation, is generally exercised by all governments
which have its management. In France the control of the telegraph
by government is loudly complained of, in consequence of
notorious abuses which result from it. Amongst other things, it is
well known that the authorities of the Bourse, in Paris, have opportunities
of seeing every telegram which reaches or leaves that
city on matters relating to the stock exchange operations.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT NOT COMPETENT TO MANAGE THE TELEGRAPHS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>If it should ever appear to be for the public good that this agency,
so capable of use as a political power, should pass into the hands of
government, it seems proper to await such a demonstration of the
self-sustaining capacity of the department under whose control it
is proposed to be placed, and such efficiency in that service, as
will furnish reasonable assurance of ability for the united control
without burden to the state, or lessened convenience to the people.
A department which is still confessedly imperfect, which cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>even tell the number of letters which it transmits per annum,
whose receipts are unequal to the cost of service by over
$6,000,000,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a> which could not secure skilled labor in this new field
except by foraging from existing enterprises, and which could not
avoid heavy losses at the rates proposed, is not at present a fit
recipient of so important a trust.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. The postal revenue for the year ending June 30th, 1868, was $16,292,600.80, and
the expenditures during the same period $22,730,592.65, showing an excess of expenditures
of $6,337,991.85. From the report of the Postmaster-General.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Post-Office Department, which already has more duties than
it is able to perform, instead of seeking to absorb the telegraphs,
had better apply itself to its proper task of developing the correspondence
of the country, and endeavor to make itself financially
profitable to the nation, instead of a serious burden.</p>

<p class='c009'>That the post-office undertakes more than it can perform is
shown by the delays and irregularities of the service, and the
enormous and constantly increasing number of its dead letters,
which amounted, in 1867, to over 4,500,000! Were the telegraph
companies to deal with the messages committed to them for
transmission as the post-office deals with the letters committed to its
care, there would be good grounds for governmental interference;
but there are very few complaints of non-delivery of telegrams.</p>

<p class='c009'>It should be borne in mind that electric telegraphy is a science,
and its successful operation requires a thorough knowledge of
electricity, skill in manipulating the apparatus, and many years of
constant training in the practical duties of the business. Many of
the employees of this company have been constantly in the service
for more than a score of years, and still consider themselves students
in this new field of practical science: without wishing to be
invidious in our comparisons, we may fairly say that the intelligence
and skill which are ample for the duties of filling a bag with
letters and despatching them by horse or steam power, would not
be competent to the duties of successfully transmitting an important
despatch through the invisible agency of the electric current.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>GOVERNMENT ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Another serious drawback to the value of the telegraph under
government management is its failure to make reparation to private
individuals for losses caused by the errors or imperfection of
its service. In no country where the telegraph exists under government
control is there any assumption of accountability for
errors or delays in the transmission of messages. In some countries
they will not even inquire into the cause of delay or errors,
and in others, as in Spain, they will only do so for the purpose of
punishing the delinquent employee, but in no case to reimburse
the patron of the telegraph for his loss. This failure to assume
any responsibility in the matter is of great importance to the
public. The amount paid by the Western Union Telegraph
Company per annum, on account of these unavoidable errors and
delays, is very considerable. The public would be reluctant to
leave the correct transmission and delivery of their important
messages to the chances of a government system which is notoriously
defective, and which would in no case reimburse them for
losses occasioned by errors in the transmission of their telegrams,
or failure to send them at all. The scheme proposed by Mr.
Hubbard, owing to the divided responsibility of the service, would
be even worse than the absorption of the lines by the government.
Public opinion could not reach the contractor, because he is the
servant of the government, and not of the public, and it would
fail to influence the Post-Office Department, as it does not itself
perform the service, and, because being a department, it is practically
irresponsible. How much influence, for example, has public
opinion on the collectors of internal revenue or customs, or even
the postmasters of this country?</p>

<p class='c009'>If despatches were left at the post-offices, or dropped in the
street boxes, as provided for in Mr. Hubbard’s bill, they would
have to take their chances of transmission and delivery, with no
recourse, in case of failure, for redress from any source. If a despatch
should fail to reach its destination, and complaint was made
to the postmaster, he would reply that he was not responsible for
its transmission, and would refer the aggrieved person to the telegraph
contractor; while the latter would answer that he was a
servant of the government, and not responsible to the public for
the imperfections of his service. And the result would be, that
while the sender of the despatch obtained no redress, he would
not have even the satisfaction of knowing which service was at
fault, the post-office or the telegraph.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>THE PROPOSITION TO ERECT COMPETITIVE GOVERNMENTAL TELEGRAPHS UNFOUNDED IN PUBLIC NECESSITY, UNJUST AND DELUSIVE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The proposition to erect a competitive governmental telegraph
line between Washington and New York, as described in the
paper of Mr. Washburne, and the bill designed to authorize it, is a
scheme founded upon no public necessity, unjust and delusive.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is easily demonstrable that the tariff proposed by the
bill, if adopted by the government, could only be maintained
by large drafts upon the national treasury. It is well known
that the active hours of telegraph service are about five, and the
ordinary average of transmission not over fifty messages per
hour, the general allowance being forty. Thus each of the four
wires proposed to be erected under the bill would be capable
of earning, at the maximum, five dollars per hour, or a total daily
income of one hundred dollars, an amount unequal to the provision
of the most ordinary indoor service, to say nothing of the
cost of management, repairs of lines, battery power, stationery,
and many other necessary expenses. The annual cost to our
company of repairs and inspection on this route alone is $20,000.</p>

<p class='c009'>This company denies the exorbitance of the rates it has
adopted, and which it is now actively engaged in modifying so
as to secure the fairest correspondence to other branches of labor,
and the utmost development of the system. It therefore deprecates
as illusory, as well as unjust, the proposal to establish rates
lower than those which in Belgium have caused a loss of one
third of the tariff on each message sent, and which, under the
management of a department now showing an enormous annual
deficit, cannot fail to prove perplexing and disastrous. It
deprecates also, as utterly illusory, the idea that under such
tariffs a product would be realized that would provide for
the extension of the government lines to other regions. This
delusion, which makes it possible for an intelligent public man
to predicate so absurd a result, has for a basis that which is
ever used to allure men into schemes of promised wealth. The
insane speculation which, thirty years ago, ruined tens of thousands
of our people, by counting the leaves of the <i>Morus multicaulis</i>
as the products of veritable mulberry-trees, on which delighted
caterpillars would feed, and enrich their owners with untold webs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of native silk, was not more illusory than that which to-day, by
showing the possibilities of each hour by day and night, crams the
wires with possible messages which will never be sent, and estimates
balances which cannot be earned.</p>

<p class='c009'>This scheme would be unjust to government, by undermining
and perilling a business which pays $300,000 per annum
to its revenues, besides casting upon a nation, great because of the
energy which has characterized its private enterprises, the odium
of initiating competition with one of the most useful products of
the national brain, before time has been given to complete the
design of those who direct it, and to fully illustrate its capacity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The policy and practice of the Western Union Telegraph Company
favor a reduction of the rates on despatches as rapidly as
the necessary expenses of the service will admit; <i>and if the government
will abolish its tax on the receipts for transmitting telegrams,
this company will immediately lower its rates until the reduction
upon the gross amount of business done shall be twice as
much as the tax remitted</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>This would lessen the rates for telegraphing nearly ten per
cent, and would be a far better plan for furnishing cheaper telegraphic
facilities to the people than the construction and operation
of government lines at the expense of the national treasury.</p>

<div class='section'>

<h3 class='c010'>THE TELEGRAPH BILL PROPOSED TO BE ENACTED BY CONGRESS WITHOUT NATIONAL EXAMPLE.</h3>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It must be borne in mind that the remunerativeness of telegraph
lines depends largely upon the revenues of a few important
cities, without which the enterprise would not have an income sufficient
to support it. To take away the receipts of New York,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, with Boston, Chicago,
Cincinnati, St. Louis, and a few others of like importance, would
make it impossible for any company to maintain itself, far less to meet
the constant demand of an enlarging population and new settlements
for the extension of its lines. This is not peculiar to America.
In Great Britain, where there are 2,151 stations, seventy-six per
cent of the entire receipts are received at 18 stations, fifteen per
cent at 81 stations, and only nine per cent at the residue. Even
of the seventy-six per cent received at the 18 stations, one half
of that whole percentage was received in London, and one quarter
from two other cities.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>In France, three departments collect 4,178,332, out of a total
of 7,707,590 francs per annum; and of this amount, Paris (Départment
de la Seine) collects 2,794,768.40 francs, being more
than one third of the total receipts of the whole empire.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Western Union Telegraph Company’s revenues come to it
in a similar manner. From its 3,331 offices it derives its receipts
as follows:—</p>

<table class='table2' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c022'>From</td>
    <td class='c020'>136</td>
    <td class='c022'>offices,</td>
    <td class='c021'>75 per cent.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c022'>„</td>
    <td class='c020'>3195</td>
    <td class='c022'>„</td>
    <td class='c021'>25 per cent.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c009'>Of these 136 offices, a large proportion of their receipts is derived
from twelve chief cities, of which four are on the route proposed
by this bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>Government, by thus operating lines of telegraph over the
choicest and most productive route, at rates below the cost of the
service, and which could only be maintained by large drafts upon
the national treasury, would assume an attitude towards private
telegraph enterprises of the most unjust and unexampled hostility.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a partial experiment as that proposed by Mr. Washburne,
or even by Mr. Hubbard, would destroy the unitary character of
the service which the Western Union Telegraph Company has
done so much to secure, and would be a most decidedly reactionary
measure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hubbard’s bill to incorporate the United States Postal Telegraph
Company, and to establish a postal-telegraph system, provides
for the establishment of telegraph lines to all cities and villages
of five thousand inhabitants and over in the United States.
Were this scheme to be adopted, and the government thus enter
into a partnership with the new company in the telegraph business,
in accordance with the terms of this bill, what is to become of the
smaller towns? According to the census of 1860 there are only
three hundred and thirteen cities and villages in the United States
having the five thousand inhabitants necessary to entitle them to
an office under this postal system. Who, then, is to maintain telegraphic
facilities at the remaining three thousand eight hundred
and thirteen small towns now having offices?</p>

<p class='c009'>Private companies, if driven out of the field by the establishment
of this semi-government competing line, could not do it, and, as
this scheme makes no provision for them, they must necessarily
be deprived of the facilities they now enjoy. Under this bill Arkansas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Florida, and Oregon would not be entitled to an office;
Minnesota, Mississippi, and South Carolina to but one; North
Carolina, Texas, and Vermont to but two each; Delaware and
Tennessee to but three; Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, and
Michigan to but four; and Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine,
Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Wisconsin
would be entitled to less than ten each, while those provided
for the whole United States would be less in number than the
branch offices furnished for the convenience of the public by the
Western Union Telegraph Company at the hotels, docks, piers,
and other places in the large towns alone.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. The Postmaster-General is permitted to establish postal-telegraph stations at any
city or village through which the lines of the contracting party may be extended,
though said city or village contain less than five thousand inhabitants; but as the proposed
company makes no provision for the payment of the operators or any of the
expenses of such offices, while it secures to itself the receipts for telegrams, it is hardly
to be expected that the Postmaster-General would feel disposed to open many stations
under such circumstances.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The proposal presented to Congress is one which the governments
of Europe, from which it professes to draw its inspiration, have
never entertained. No government there has ever yet attempted to
engage in any public work by the destruction of the property of its
people, except after just compensation. The recent example of
Great Britain in acquiring the British lines of telegraph is eminently
illustrative of this national justice. Neither cavilling with the
nature or condition of their structure, cheapening the value of their
property, nor defaming the officers of any company, the British
Parliament doubles the valuation of its owners, and pays a price
therefor which satisfies the most exacting. In striking contrast to
this is the enterprise proposed to the American Congress by the
Washburne bill, which begins by attacking the integrity of the
official management of the existing system, depreciating the value
of its property, and proposing the competitive use of a grand invention
which it refused to purchase, and now proposes, without
consideration, to possess. In such a project there is no national
example which would give it sanction or respectability, even
though, in times of great national peril, and amid the necessities of
despotic governments, monarchs have at times seized and made
their own the profitable traffic and pursuits of the people.</p>

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. From the Cincinnati Gazette.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The building of telegraph lines in the United States, from the date of
their inauguration down to the present time, has been overdone. There
are now too many wires for the business, at the prices that are charged;
consequently there are few, if any, lines that pay a fair interest on the
cost of their construction. So great is the cost of maintaining and operating
lines, too, that it is a question whether sufficient business could be
done, as it is conducted at very low rates, to pay expenses. In business
hours, for example, there is a great rush of messages,—say from 9 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>
to 3 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>—that is, between commercial centres. After 3 o’clock there
is comparatively little business, except what is furnished by the newspapers.
Consequently, in the after part of the day, and during the night,
many wires and operators are idle. In order to make business for this
portion of the twenty-four hours, the telegraph companies adopted a low
schedule of rates for night messages, but this has been attended with poor
success. The lines are mainly used, it is found, by business men and
newspapers. Business messages require immediate delivery, and are not
valuable except when transmitted and delivered during business hours.
Hence the reduced rates for night messages has not created much new
business. Neither would low rates for day messages create new business,
unless the despatches could be promptly forwarded and delivered. Low
rates for day messages, prompt delivery being insured, would undoubtedly
largely increase the business, but this would require more wires and
more men. The question then is, would the income at low rates be sufficient
to pay for the increased expenditures? Telegraph managers have
decided this question in the negative. There is, it must be borne in
mind, a limit to the capacity of telegraph wires for conveying news.
Herein this system differs from the postal system. There is, practically,
no limit to the capacity of the railroad companies for carrying the mails,
and, of course, the profits of the postal department are in proportion to
the amount of business they transact. These preliminary remarks are
made in order that the public may the better understand the proposition
which has been made, and is being agitated, looking to the purchase of
the telegraph lines by the government, and their operation in connection
with the postal system. The pretext is, that the government could afford
to reduce the tariff to a low point, say one cent per word for five hundred
miles or less, and two cents for over five hundred up to one thousand, &amp;c.
This would make the tariff between Cincinnati and New York three
cents, whereas it is now ten cents, for private messages. This is the pretext,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>but the real secret of the movement is this. There are two parties
who favor the proposition. One of these has been quietly buying up
telegraph stock at thirty or forty cents on the dollar. They propose to
have Congress pass a law authorizing the President to appoint three commissioners
to value the telegraph lines of the United States and providing
for their purchase at such valuation. Here is a fine chance for speculation.
It would afford an admirable opening for the gentlemen who
practise in the lobby. The second party favoring the purchase is composed
of members of Congress who are anxious to have the franking
privilege extended to the telegraph lines. What a splendid thing it
would be if members of Congress could use the telegraph lines free, as
they use the mails. But the people would have to pay for the free business
on the telegraph lines,—pay dearly, too, as they pay for the uses
and abuses of the postal franking privilege. Besides, the government,
in connection with the postal system, is mainly conspicuous for its mismanagement.
It does not compete successfully with private enterprise,
and never can so long as the abominable system of filling and vacating
offices is continued. The telegraph business is decidedly complicated.
It requires skilful men to operate it. How would it be if telegraph offices
were to be filled as post-offices and revenue offices are filled? We
need not stop to answer this question. Besides, secrecy is an important
feature of the telegraph business. It is not as carefully enforced as it
should be; but what a political machine the telegraph would become if
partisan politicians should get hold of it! Imagine the telegraph during
an exciting presidential campaign, with one party controlling the wires
and reading all the private despatches that passed over the lines! There
would be no secrecy about it; neither would it be reliable, and in the end
it would cost the people more than those using it would save. Not one
man in twenty would use the telegraph if rates were even lower than is
proposed; and consequently nineteen men would be taxed for the benefit
of one. The whole thing would be a tax upon the people, without compensating
advantages. If private enterprise, with sharp competition,
cannot carry messages between New York and Cincinnati, at ten cents
per word, and make money, the government could not do it at three cents,
or at any price up to ten. Nothing more certain than that. Besides, the
corruption connected with office-holding and office-getting, in this country,
is sufficient to cause the people to shudder at the mere proposition to add
fifty thousand offices to the already enormous federal patronage. The
government is staggering now under the tremendous load of corruption
consequent upon the federal patronage and the mode of distributing it,
and the people must soon choose between a reform in this or a revolution.
Let it be first demonstrated, therefore, that the government can successfully,
honestly, and economically manage the business intrusted to it before
it undertakes to assume exclusive control of other branches of private
enterprise. But, as already stated, the present movement is merely
a scheme to saddle upon the government the non-paying telegraph lines
of the United States, at three or four times their value. The result
would be amazing corruption in the management of the lines, the violation
of private confidence for personal or political purposes, and a cost
to the people for telegraphing greater than is now borne by those who use
the wires.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>POSTAL TELEGRAPH.—EXTENSION OF THE INTERFERENCE THEORY.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. From the Chicago Evening Post.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We beg the advocates of the Postal Telegraph scheme not to stop.
The justification of what they propose to do, if in accordance with their
theories of government, will cover many other things necessary to be
done. After having taken possession of the telegraph lines, and increased
the number of officers necessary to insure the harmonious working
of their plan, let them turn their attention to the Express business of
the country, in which there is room for great reform. This, we are told,
is practically a monopoly, by the greed of which the transmission of merchandise
and valuables from one part of the country to another is often
slow, and always expensive. If it is the province of the government to
take charge of the telegraphic correspondence of the people, surely there
is no abuse of authority in undertaking to carry, and in making a monopoly
of carrying, their express packages; and the reasons which commend
this telegraph scheme cover and justify the extension of governmental
interference with the small freight that the express lines usually convey.
We state these reasons <i>seriatim</i>, just as the advocates of governmental
telegraphing rehearse them. They are, first, cheapness; second, certainty;
third, celerity; fourth, promotion of intercourse and traffic between
different sections of the country; and consequently, fifth, the
wider dissemination of intelligence. If these are sufficient,—and no
promoter of the telegraph scheme can doubt that they are,—they admit
of still wider application. Most of the telegraphic correspondence of the
country is of a business character, and so most of the service rendered by
the express is of the same sort. The telegraph and the express are the
adjuncts of our great commercial transactions by which people are fed,
warmed, clothed, and supplied with the implements and raw material of
labor. There is, then, no reason why the railroads, which are only larger
instruments of the same kind, should be omitted in the list of things that
the government may manage and monopolize. It is surely of as much
moment that a train-load of flour or butter should be carried with cheapness,
certainty, and celerity from Chicago to New York, as that the despatch
announcing its shipment or arrival should be sent in the same way;
and if we cannot manage the latter to our satisfaction, how shall we expect
to manage the former? As it will never do to have a competitor in
this carrying trade, the government must also take possession of all the
canals. Of course these recommendations will, if adopted, largely increase
the salaried officers of the country, and make our political contests
tenfold more corrupt, acrimonious, and dangerous than now; but as the
Pennsylvania editor said about protection—“If protection is a good
thing, we cannot have too much of it!”—so say we of officials, the more
the better.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we see still larger fields that the government may occupy, this interference
theory being established as the rule of its relation to the people.
As the growing of wheat and the production of meats, to supply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>the prime necessity of our nature for food, are of far more importance
than the correspondence which occurs in getting the wheat and beef to
the consumer or than the method of their transit; as the people must die
if they have nothing to eat; as farming, as now done, is a careless, haphazard
business, pursued without the aid of adequate machinery or the
proper division of labor; as the cost of farm produce might, by the universal
adoption of improved methods, be greatly cheapened, thus promoting
the increase of the race, and adding immensely to the general happiness,
the government ought, first of all, to take the agriculture of the
country into its keeping. Then how easy, if it should be imposed upon
by the men who make agricultural implements, to turn manufacturer at
some hundred convenient places and make all the tools it might need.
Just think of the immense advantage of being able to go to a government
warehouse and get a barrel of flour for half what it now costs, or of
stepping into government shambles from which, of course, the people
will be fed, and getting a rib-roast or tenderloin steak at a figure that
would make our city butchers ashamed. Of course, every farmer would
be a government officer, sure of his pay, and without the most powerful
stimulus to exertion; but if each man who handles a letter or sends or
delivers a despatch is to have the livery of public service on his back,
why not? Finally, as food is useless unless cooked, we see the necessity—still
reasoning on premises which the telegraph men furnish—of having
the cooking and management of the kitchens of the country turned
over to such officers as the government shall select. For doing this, just
as soon as the plan of governmental telegraphing is put into operation,
the reasons will be entirely conclusive. What, we ask, can be of more
importance than that our food should be of good quality, healthfully prepared,
quickly and neatly served, and peacefully eaten. Put the National
Telegraph by the side of the National Dinner, and see how it is
dwarfed by the comparison. Contrast the annoyance of a telegram overcharged,
missent, or delayed, with the unutterable horrors of indigestion.
Look at our hotels, restaurants, and private houses, and see how cruelly
the people suffer; then think how perfect, how quick, and how cheap the
relief that the government might extend. We well know that, had government
cooking always been the rule of the nation, the great rebellion
would not have occurred. The war was the result of the bad food and
worse kitchens of our brethren of the South. It had its origin in hot
bread and hog, which ruined the stomachs, perverted the morals, and inflamed
the worst passions of the South. As we have already sacrificed
half a million of lives, and ten thousand millions of treasure to repair
the consequences of government carelessness in suffering national cookshops
to remain unestablished, we cannot make too much haste in opening
them now.</p>

<p class='c009'>But we have adduced examples enough to show the absurd conclusions
to which the reasoning of these telegraphic schemers logically leads.
Our government, good as it is, has objectionable features enough now.
The disparities in the condition of the people are due more to the operation
of unjust law than to differences in natural gifts; and the great
source of mischief is in the usurpation by government of functions it
ought never to exercise. We do most assuredly need reform; but we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>shall not find it in enlarging the sphere within which the government may
act, nor in curtailing or circumscribing the liberty of the individual. Let
us go in the other direction; and instead of making the paternal rule of
Continental monarchies the object of imitation, let us extend the application
of the American idea. Instead of clothing government with new
powers, let us take from what it has. Instead of creating an army of
new officers, let us dismiss half we have got. Instead of increasing the
patronage of the executive and the causes of political contention, let us
give greater simplicity to our system and greater security to the citizen
and the state. Instead of training the people more and more to rely
upon the government to supply their business, social, and educational
wants, let us give greater scope to their individuality, so that they may
more and more rely upon themselves. Our government differs from all
other governments in the world in nothing so much as in its capacity of
letting the people alone in their houses, their business, their religion, and
their pleasure. Our people differ from all other peoples in nothing so
much as in the fact that, comparatively, they are let alone. All that the
country is, it owes to the partial freedom of its citizens to go where they
please, do what they please, and think and speak their own thoughts;
which freedom, by cultivating strength, self-reliance, enterprise, intelligence,
and patriotism, has wrought the work we see before us. This
freedom is to be still more extended over ground which inherited abuses
now occupy, and the consequences will astonish the world!</p>

<p class='c009'>No, no! Our government is not a wet-nurse for all the schemes which
the ingenuity of men may invent, or which incomplete and half-seen considerations
of public convenience may recommend. It is primarily an
organization for the protection of person and property, and the punishment
of crime. And to keep it within its sphere, and to disassociate it,
as far as possible, from the usual business of the citizen, is to insure its
life. Leave to the people all that individual or corporate effort may do,
and they will do it well. Leave to the government the preservation of
order and the punishment of crime, and the governed will have no reason
to complain.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>TELEGRAPHING BY GOVERNMENT.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a></h3>

<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. From the New York Tribune.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We use the telegraph very extensively and pay it a good deal of money;
so that there are few whose personal advantage from cheapening its use
would be greater than our own; yet we do not regard with favor any of
the bills looking to the establishment of a Government Telegraph. Here
are some of our reasons:—</p>

<p class='c009'>I. The prevalent tendency in our day is toward a further restriction
rather than an enlargement of the sphere of government. We have
(for instance) a good many public markets in this city, which are, for the
most part, public nuisances. Had the city left this whole business of purveying
free to private enterprise, only overseeing it in the interest of
public health, few can doubt that our supply of food would have been
better and cheaper than it is. The same is the case with many other attempts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>to serve or save the citizen through the agency of government.
Most certainly, we would not limit the sphere of government to the mere
prevention of breaking heads and picking pockets; but we should ponder
long before enlarging it.</p>

<p class='c009'>II.  A Government Telegraph is usually proposed as an adjunct of the
post-office. Our government already claims and enforces a monopoly
of the business of carrying letters, charges its own prices, collects some
$15,000,000 a year from the people for letter-carrying, and then loses
some $6,000,000 a year by the business. We submit that it should show
a better balance-sheet on this account before extending its sphere of
operations.</p>

<p class='c009'>III. We never owned any telegraph stock, and expect to own none;
we are a daily and heavy customer to telegraphs, and expect to live and die
such. We presume that a Government Telegraph would somewhat
cheapen the cost of messages; but the money invested in establishing it
would never be returned to the treasury. The clamor for a reduction of
charges (as now with letters) would steadily overbear any hope of profit.
Can it be right, we ask, to tax the whole people for the benefit of that
small minority who send messages by telegraph? Would it not be
better to start government establishments for potato-growing on a gigantic
scale, so as to supply the poor cheaply with wholesome and nourishing
food? Where one wants cheap messages, many would be benefited by
having a sure and ample supply of cheap potatoes.</p>

<p class='c009'>IV. Government, in this and other free countries, is and must be
largely an affair of party. The government of this country has been, is,
and must be, to a great extent, the rule of the dominant party. Would
it be well to have the telegraph under the absolute control of either
party in an excited Presidential election? Could the outs safely use it?
Could the people implicitly trust it? Remember how the mails were
rifled under Jackson, with the tacit approval of Postmaster-General
Kendall, on the assumption that it was right to take and burn Abolition
documents if circulated in Slave States. Consider General Jackson’s and
Governor Marcy’s official recommendations that the circulation of such
documents be prohibited by law. We should not like to have the telegraph
controlled, throughout the ensuing Presidential canvasses, by our
political adversaries, nor yet by our political friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>V.  The government is heavily in debt, and its finances are not in
good condition; yet it is bored and importuned for subsidies on this side
and on that,—all of them on the pretence of public advantage, many of
them with just grounds for such assumption. If the Northern and
Southern Pacific Railroads could both be built within the next five years,
we believe they would add five hundred millions of dollars to our
national wealth within the twenty years succeeding. We demur to their
present construction by government aid, simply that the state of our finances
forbids it. But if our government is able to build telegraphs where
they are not wanted, why not railroads where they are the very first
necessity of settlement and civilization?</p>

<p class='c009'>We might go on for an hour longer, but let the above suffice for the
present. We think the government should let the telegraph business
alone.</p>
